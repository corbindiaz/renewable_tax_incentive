However, any separate legal entity, the membership of which consists only of electric utilities as defined in s. 361.11(2) and which is created for the purpose of exercising the powers granted by part II of chapter 361, the Joint Power Act, may, for the purpose of financing or refinancing the costs of an electric project, exercise all powers in connection with the authorization, issuance, and sale of bonds as are conferred by parts I, II, and III of chapter 159 or part II of chapter 166, or both. Any such entity may also issue bond anticipation notes, as provided by s. 215.431, in connection with the authorization, issuance, and sale of such bonds. All of the privileges, benefits, powers, and terms of parts I, II, and III of chapter 159 and part II of chapter 166, notwithstanding any limitations provided above, shall be fully applicable to such entity. In addition, the governing body of such legal entity may also authorize bonds to be issued and sold from time to time and delegate, to such officer, official, or agent of such legal entity as the governing body of such legal entity shall select, the power to determine the time; manner of sale, public or private; maturities; rate or rates of interest, which may be fixed or may vary at such time or times and in accordance with a specified formula or method of determination; and other terms and conditions as may be deemed appropriate by the officer, official, or agent so designated by the governing body of such legal entity.

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c), any separate legal entity created pursuant to this section and controlled by the municipalities or counties of this state or by one or more municipalities and one or more counties of this state, the membership of which consists or is to consist of municipalities only, counties only, or one or more municipalities and one or more counties, may, for the purpose of financing or refinancing any capital projects, exercise all powers in connection with the authorization, issuance, and sale of bonds. Notwithstanding any limitations provided in this section, all of the privileges, benefits, powers, and terms of part I of chapter 125, part II of chapter 166, and part I of chapter 159 are fully applicable to such entity. Bonds issued by such entity are deemed issued on behalf of the counties, municipalities, or private entities which enter into loan agreements with such entity as provided in this paragraph. Any loan agreement executed pursuant to a program of such entity is governed by the provisions of part I of chapter 159 or, in the case of counties, part I of chapter 125, or in the case of municipalities and charter counties, part II of chapter 166. Proceeds of bonds issued by such entity may be loaned to counties or municipalities of this state or a combination of municipalities and counties, whether or not such counties or municipalities are also members of the entity issuing the bonds, or to private entities for projects that are “self-liquidating,” as provided in s. 159.02, whether or not such private entities are located within the jurisdictional boundaries of a county or municipality that is a member of the entity issuing the bonds. The issuance of bonds by such entity to fund a loan program to make loans to municipalities, counties, or private entities or a combination of municipalities, counties, and private entities with one another for capital projects to be identified subsequent to the issuance of the bonds to fund such loan programs is deemed to be a paramount public purpose.

In addition, the governing body of such legal entity may also authorize bonds to be issued and sold from time to time and may delegate, to such officer, official, or agent of such legal entity as the governing body of such legal entity may select, the power to determine the time; manner of sale, public or private; maturities; rate or rates of interest, which may be fixed or may vary at such time or times and in accordance with a specified formula or method of determination; and other terms and conditions as may be deemed appropriate by the officer, official, or agent so designated by the governing body of such legal entity.

A local government self-insurance fund established under this section may financially guarantee bonds or bond anticipation notes issued or loans made under this subsection. Bonds issued pursuant to this paragraph may be validated as provided in chapter 75. The complaint in any action to validate such bonds shall be filed only in the Circuit Court for Leon County. The notice required to be published by s. 75.06 shall be published only in Leon County, and the complaint and order of the circuit court shall be served only on the State Attorney of the Second Judicial Circuit and on the state attorney of each circuit in each county where the public agencies which were initially a party to the agreement are located. Notice of such proceedings shall be published in the manner and the time required by s. 75.06 in Leon County and in each county where the public agencies which were initially a party to the agreement are located. Obligations of any county or municipality pursuant to a loan agreement as described in this paragraph may be validated as provided in chapter 75.

(e)1. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c), any separate legal entity, created pursuant to the provisions of this section and controlled by counties or municipalities of this state, the membership of which consists or is to consist only of public agencies of this state, may, for the purpose of financing the provision or acquisition of liability or property coverage contracts for or from one or more local government liability or property pools to provide liability or property coverage for counties, municipalities, or other public agencies of this state, exercise all powers in connection with the authorization, issuance, and sale of bonds. All of the privileges, benefits, powers, and terms of s. 125.01 relating to counties and s. 166.021 relating to municipalities shall be fully applicable to such entity and such entity shall be considered a unit of local government for all of the privileges, benefits, powers, and terms of part I of chapter 159. Bonds issued by such entity shall be deemed issued on behalf of counties, municipalities, or public agencies which enter into loan agreements with such entity as provided in this paragraph. Proceeds of bonds issued by such entity may be loaned to counties, municipalities, or other public agencies of this state, whether or not such counties, municipalities, or other public agencies are also members of the entity issuing the bonds, and such counties, municipalities, or other public agencies may in turn deposit such loan proceeds with a separate local government liability or property pool for purposes of providing or acquiring liability or property coverage contracts.2. Counties or municipalities of this state are authorized pursuant to this section, in addition to the authority provided by s. 125.01, part II of chapter 166, and other applicable law, to issue bonds for the purpose of acquiring liability coverage contracts from a local government liability pool. Any individual county or municipality may, by entering into interlocal agreements with other counties, municipalities, or public agencies of this state, issue bonds on behalf of itself and other counties, municipalities, or other public agencies, for purposes of acquiring a liability coverage contract or contracts from a local government liability pool. Counties, municipalities, or other public agencies are also authorized to enter into loan agreements with any entity created pursuant to subparagraph 1., or with any county or municipality issuing bonds pursuant to this subparagraph, for the purpose of obtaining bond proceeds with which to acquire liability coverage contracts from a local government liability pool. No county, municipality, or other public agency shall at any time have more than one loan agreement outstanding for the purpose of obtaining bond proceeds with which to acquire liability coverage contracts from a local government liability pool. Obligations of any county, municipality, or other public agency of this state pursuant to a loan agreement as described above may be validated as provided in chapter 75. Prior to the issuance of any bonds pursuant to subparagraph 1. or this subparagraph for the purpose of acquiring liability coverage contracts from a local government liability pool, the reciprocal insurer or the manager of any self-insurance program shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Office of Insurance Regulation of the Financial Services Commission that excess liability coverage for counties, municipalities, or other public agencies is reasonably unobtainable in the amounts provided by such pool or that the liability coverage obtained through acquiring contracts from a local government liability pool, after taking into account costs of issuance of bonds and any other administrative fees, is less expensive to counties, municipalities, or special districts than similar commercial coverage then reasonably available.3. Any entity created pursuant to this section or any county or municipality may also issue bond anticipation notes, as provided by s. 215.431, in connection with the authorization, issuance, and sale of such bonds. In addition, the governing body of such legal entity or the governing body of such county or municipality may also authorize bonds to be issued and sold from time to time and may delegate, to such officer, official, or agent of such legal entity as the governing body of such legal entity may select, the power to determine the time; manner of sale, public or private; maturities; rate or rates of interest, which may be fixed or may vary at such time or times and in accordance with a specified formula or method of determination; and other terms and conditions as may be deemed appropriate by the officer, official, or agent so designated by the governing body of such legal entity. However, the amounts and maturities of such bonds and the interest rate or rates of such bonds shall be within the limits prescribed by the governing body of such legal entity and its resolution delegating to such officer, official, or agent the power to authorize the issuance and sale of such bonds. Any series of bonds issued pursuant to this paragraph for liability coverage shall mature no later than 7 years following the date of issuance. A series of bonds issued pursuant to this paragraph for property coverage shall mature no later than 30 years following the date of issuance.4. Bonds issued pursuant to subparagraph 1. may be validated as provided in chapter 75. The complaint in any action to validate such bonds shall be filed only in the Circuit Court for Leon County. The notice required to be published by s. 75.06 shall be published in Leon County and in each county which is an owner of the entity issuing the bonds, or in which a member of the entity is located, and the complaint and order of the circuit court shall be served only on the State Attorney of the Second Judicial Circuit and on the state attorney of each circuit in each county or municipality which is an owner of the entity issuing the bonds or in which a member of the entity is located.5. Bonds issued pursuant to subparagraph 2. may be validated as provided in chapter 75. The complaint in any action to validate such bonds shall be filed in the circuit court of the county or municipality which will issue the bonds. The notice required to be published by s. 75.06 shall be published only in the county where the complaint is filed, and the complaint and order of the circuit court shall be served only on the state attorney of the circuit in the county or municipality which will issue the bonds.6. The participation by any county, municipality, or other public agency of this state in a local government liability pool shall not be deemed a waiver of immunity to the extent of liability coverage, nor shall any contract entered regarding such a local government liability pool be required to contain any provision for waiver.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any separate legal entity, created pursuant to the provisions of this section, wholly owned by the municipalities or counties of this state, the membership of which consists or is to consist only of municipalities or counties of this state, may exercise the right and power of eminent domain, including the procedural powers under chapters 73 and 74, if such right and power is granted to such entity by the interlocal agreement creating the entity.

(g)1. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, any separate legal entity created under this section, the membership of which is limited to municipalities and counties of the state, and which may include a special district in addition to a municipality or county or both, may acquire, own, construct, improve, operate, and manage public facilities, or finance facilities on behalf of any person, relating to a governmental function or purpose, including, but not limited to, wastewater facilities, water or alternative water supply facilities, and water reuse facilities, which may serve populations within or outside of the members of the entity. Notwithstanding s. 367.171(7), any separate legal entity created under this paragraph is not subject to Public Service Commission jurisdiction. The separate legal entity may not provide utility services within the service area of an existing utility system unless it has received the consent of the utility.2. For purposes of this paragraph, the term:a. “Host government” means the governing body of the county, if the largest number of equivalent residential connections currently served by a system of the utility is located in the unincorporated area, or the governing body of a municipality, if the largest number of equivalent residential connections currently served by a system of the utility is located within that municipality’s boundaries.b. “Separate legal entity” means any entity created by interlocal agreement the membership of which is limited to two or more special districts, municipalities, or counties of the state, but which entity is legally separate and apart from any of its member governments.c. “System” means a water or wastewater facility or group of such facilities owned by one entity or affiliate entities.d. “Utility” means a water or wastewater utility and includes every person, separate legal entity, lessee, trustee, or receiver owning, operating, managing, or controlling a system, or proposing construction of a system, who is providing, or proposes to provide, water or wastewater service to the public for compensation.3. A separate legal entity that seeks to acquire any utility shall notify the host government in writing by certified mail about the contemplated acquisition not less than 30 days before any proposed transfer of ownership, use, or possession of any utility assets by such separate legal entity. The potential acquisition notice shall be provided to the legislative head of the governing body of the host government and to its chief administrative officer and shall provide the name and address of a contact person for the separate legal entity and information identified in s. 367.071(4)(a) concerning the contemplated acquisition.4.a. Within 30 days following receipt of the notice, the host government may adopt a resolution to become a member of the separate legal entity, adopt a resolution to approve the utility acquisition, or adopt a resolution to prohibit the utility acquisition by the separate legal entity if the host government determines that the proposed acquisition is not in the public interest. A resolution adopted by the host government which prohibits the acquisition may include conditions that would make the proposal acceptable to the host government.b. If a host government adopts a membership resolution, the separate legal entity shall accept the host government as a member on the same basis as its existing members before any transfer of ownership, use, or possession of the utility or the utility facilities. If a host government adopts a resolution to approve the utility acquisition, the separate legal entity may complete the acquisition. If a host government adopts a prohibition resolution, the separate legal entity may not acquire the utility within that host government’s territory without the specific consent of the host government by future resolution. If a host government does not adopt a prohibition resolution or an approval resolution, the separate legal entity may proceed to acquire the utility after the 30-day notice period without further notice.5. After the acquisition or construction of any utility systems by a separate legal entity created under this paragraph, revenues or any other income may not be transferred or paid to a member of a separate legal entity, or to any other special district, county, or municipality, from user fees or other charges or revenues generated from customers that are not physically located within the jurisdictional or service delivery boundaries of the member, special district, county, or municipality receiving the transfer or payment. Any transfer or payment to a member, special district, or other local government must be solely from user fees or other charges or revenues generated from customers that are physically located within the jurisdictional or service delivery boundaries of the member, special district, or local government receiving the transfer of payment.6. This section is an alternative provision otherwise provided by law as authorized in s. 4, Art. VIII of the State Constitution for any transfer of power as a result of an acquisition of a utility by a separate legal entity from a municipality, county, or special district.7. The entity may finance or refinance the acquisition, construction, expansion, and improvement of such facilities relating to a governmental function or purpose through the issuance of its bonds, notes, or other obligations under this section or as otherwise authorized by law. The entity has all the powers provided by the interlocal agreement under which it is created or which are necessary to finance, own, operate, or manage the public facility, including, without limitation, the power to establish rates, charges, and fees for products or services provided by it, the power to levy special assessments, the power to sell or finance all or a portion of such facility, and the power to contract with a public or private entity to manage and operate such facilities or to provide or receive facilities, services, or products. Except as may be limited by the interlocal agreement under which the entity is created, all of the privileges, benefits, powers, and terms of s. 125.01, relating to counties, and s. 166.021, relating to municipalities, are fully applicable to the entity. However, neither the entity nor any of its members on behalf of the entity may exercise the power of eminent domain over the facilities or property of any existing water or wastewater plant utility system, nor may the entity acquire title to any water or wastewater plant utility facilities, other facilities, or property which was acquired by the use of eminent domain after the effective date of this act, unless 10 or more years have elapsed since the date of the acquisition by eminent domain. Bonds, notes, and other obligations issued by the entity are issued on behalf of the public agencies that are members of the entity.8. Any entity created under this section may also issue bond anticipation notes in connection with the authorization, issuance, and sale of bonds. The bonds may be issued as serial bonds or as term bonds or both. Any entity may issue capital appreciation bonds or variable rate bonds. Any bonds, notes, or other obligations must be authorized by resolution of the governing body of the entity and bear the date or dates; mature at the time or times, not exceeding 40 years from their respective dates; bear interest at the rate or rates; be payable at the time or times; be in the denomination; be in the form; carry the registration privileges; be executed in the manner; be payable from the sources and in the medium or payment and at the place; and be subject to the terms of redemption, including redemption prior to maturity, as the resolution may provide. If any officer whose signature, or a facsimile of whose signature, appears on any bonds, notes, or other obligations ceases to be an officer before the delivery of the bonds, notes, or other obligations, the signature or facsimile is valid and sufficient for all purposes as if he or she had remained in office until the delivery. The bonds, notes, or other obligations may be sold at public or private sale for such price as the governing body of the entity shall determine. Pending preparation of the definitive bonds, the entity may issue interim certificates, which shall be exchanged for the definitive bonds. The bonds may be secured by a form of credit enhancement, if any, as the entity deems appropriate. The bonds may be secured by an indenture of trust or trust agreement. In addition, the governing body of the legal entity may delegate, to an officer, official, or agent of the legal entity as the governing body of the legal entity may select, the power to determine the time; manner of sale, public or private; maturities; rate of interest, which may be fixed or may vary at the time and in accordance with a specified formula or method of determination; and other terms and conditions as may be deemed appropriate by the officer, official, or agent so designated by the governing body of the legal entity. However, the amount and maturity of the bonds, notes, or other obligations and the interest rate of the bonds, notes, or other obligations must be within the limits prescribed by the governing body of the legal entity and its resolution delegating to an officer, official, or agent the power to authorize the issuance and sale of the bonds, notes, or other obligations.9. Bonds, notes, or other obligations issued under this paragraph may be validated as provided in chapter 75. The complaint in any action to validate the bonds, notes, or other obligations must be filed only in the Circuit Court for Leon County. The notice required to be published by s. 75.06 must be published in Leon County and in each county that is a member of the entity issuing the bonds, notes, or other obligations, or in which a member of the entity is located, and the complaint and order of the circuit court must be served only on the State Attorney of the Second Judicial Circuit and on the state attorney of each circuit in each county that is a member of the entity issuing the bonds, notes, or other obligations or in which a member of the entity is located. Section 75.04(2) does not apply to a complaint for validation brought by the legal entity.10. The accomplishment of the authorized purposes of a legal entity created under this paragraph is in all respects for the benefit of the people of the state, for the increase of their commerce and prosperity, and for the improvement of their health and living conditions. Since the legal entity will perform essential governmental functions for the public health, safety, and welfare in accomplishing its purposes, the legal entity is not required to pay any taxes or assessments of any kind whatsoever upon any property acquired or used by it for such purposes or upon any revenues at any time received by it, whether the property is within or outside the jurisdiction of members of the entity. The exemption provided in this paragraph applies regardless of whether the separate legal entity enters into agreements with private firms or entities to manage, operate, or improve the utilities owned by the separate legal entity. The bonds, notes, and other obligations of an entity, their transfer, and the income therefrom, including any profits made on the sale thereof, are at all times free from taxation of any kind by the state or by any political subdivision or other agency or instrumentality thereof. The exemption granted in this subparagraph is not applicable to any tax imposed by chapter 220 on interest, income, or profits on debt obligations owned by corporations.

(h)1. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c), any separate legal entity consisting of an alliance, as defined in s. 395.106(2)(a), created pursuant to this paragraph and controlled by and whose members consist of eligible entities comprised of special districts created pursuant to a special act and having the authority to own or operate one or more hospitals licensed in this state or hospitals licensed in this state that are owned, operated, or funded by a county or municipality, for the purpose of providing property insurance coverage as defined in s. 395.106(2)(b), for such eligible entities, may exercise all powers under this subsection in connection with borrowing funds for such purposes, including, without limitation, the authorization, issuance, and sale of bonds, notes, or other obligations of indebtedness. Borrowed funds, including, but not limited to, bonds issued by such alliance shall be deemed issued on behalf of such eligible entities that enter into loan agreements with such separate legal entity as provided in this paragraph.2. Any such separate legal entity shall have all the powers that are provided by the interlocal agreement under which the entity is created or that are necessary to finance, operate, or manage the alliance’s property insurance coverage program. Proceeds of bonds, notes, or other obligations issued by such an entity may be loaned to any one or more eligible entities. Such eligible entities are authorized to enter into loan agreements with any separate legal entity created pursuant to this paragraph for the purpose of obtaining moneys with which to finance property insurance coverage or claims. Obligations of any eligible entity pursuant to a loan agreement as described in this paragraph may be validated as provided in chapter 75.3. Any bonds, notes, or other obligations to be issued or incurred by a separate legal entity created pursuant to this paragraph shall be authorized by resolution of the governing body of such entity and bear the date or dates; mature at the time or times, not exceeding 30 years from their respective dates; bear interest at the rate or rates, which may be fixed or vary at such time or times and in accordance with a specified formula or method of determination; be payable at the time or times; be in the denomination; be in the form; carry the registration privileges; be executed in the manner; be payable from the sources and in the medium of payment and at the place; and be subject to redemption, including redemption prior to maturity, as the resolution may provide. The bonds, notes, or other obligations may be sold at public or private sale for such price as the governing body of the separate legal entity shall determine. The bonds may be secured by such credit enhancement, if any, as the governing body of the separate legal entity deems appropriate. The bonds may be secured by an indenture of trust or trust agreement. In addition, the governing body of the separate legal entity may delegate, to such officer or official of such entity as the governing body may select, the power to determine the time; manner of sale, public or private; maturities; rate or rates of interest, which may be fixed or may vary at such time or times and in accordance with a specified formula or method of determination; and other terms and conditions as may be deemed appropriate by the officer or official so designated by the governing body of such separate legal entity. However, the amounts and maturities of such bonds, the interest rate or rates, and the purchase price of such bonds shall be within the limits prescribed by the governing body of such separate legal entity in its resolution delegating to such officer or official the power to authorize the issuance and sale of such bonds.4. Bonds issued pursuant to this paragraph may be validated as provided in chapter 75. The complaint in any action to validate such bonds shall be filed only in the Circuit Court for Leon County. The notice required to be published by s. 75.06 shall be published in Leon County and in each county in which an eligible entity that is a member of an alliance is located. The complaint and order of the circuit court shall be served only on the State Attorney of the Second Judicial Circuit and on the state attorney of each circuit in each county in which an eligible entity receiving bond proceeds is located.5. The accomplishment of the authorized purposes of a separate legal entity created under this paragraph is deemed in all respects for the benefit, increase of the commerce and prosperity, and improvement of the health and living conditions of the people of this state. Inasmuch as the separate legal entity performs essential public functions in accomplishing its purposes, the separate legal entity is not required to pay any taxes or assessments of any kind upon any property acquired or used by the entity for such purposes or upon any revenues at any time received by the entity. The bonds, notes, and other obligations of such separate legal entity, the transfer of and income from such bonds, notes, and other obligations, including any profits made on the sale of such bonds, notes, and other obligations, are at all times free from taxation of any kind of the state or by any political subdivision or other agency or instrumentality of the state. The exemption granted in this paragraph does not apply to any tax imposed by chapter 220 on interest, income, or profits on debt obligations owned by corporations.6. The participation by any eligible entity in an alliance or a separate legal entity created pursuant to this paragraph may not be deemed a waiver of immunity to the extent of liability or any other coverage, and a contract entered regarding such alliance is not required to contain any provision for waiver.

(b)1. In any case in which any such public agency or legal entity, or both, participate in an electric project with any one or more of the following:a. Any such legal entity;b. One or more electric utilities;c. One or more foreign public utilities; ord. Any other person,and if the right to full possession and to all of the use, services, output, and capacity of any such electric project during the original estimated useful life thereof is vested, subject to creditors’ rights, in any one or more of such legal entities, electric utilities, or foreign public utilities, or in any combination thereof, such public agency or legal entity, or both, may enter into an agreement or agreements with respect to such electric project with the other person or persons participating therein, and such legal entity may enter into an agreement or agreements with one or more public agencies who are parties to the interlocal agreement creating such legal entity. Any such agreement may be for such period, including, but not limited to, an unspecified period, and may contain such other terms, conditions, and provisions, consistent with the provisions of this section, as the parties thereto shall determine. In connection with entry into and performance pursuant to any such agreement, with the selection of any person or persons with which any such public agency or legal entity, or both, may enter into any such agreement, and with the selection of any electric project to which such agreement may relate, no such public agency or legal entity shall be required to comply with any general, local, or special statute, including, but not limited to, the provisions of s. 287.055, or with any charter provision of any public agency, which would otherwise require public bidding, competitive negotiation, or both.2. Any such agreement may include, but need not be limited to, any or all of the following:a. Provisions defining what constitutes a default thereunder and providing for the rights and remedies of the parties thereto upon the occurrence of such a default, including, without limitation, the right to discontinue the delivery of products or services to a defaulting party and requirements that

with respect to such electric project.f. Provisions that any such public agency or legal entity, or both, will not rescind, terminate, or amend any contract or agreement relating to such electric project without the consent of one or more persons with which such public agency or legal entity, or both, have entered into an agreement pursuant to this section or without the consent of one or more persons with whom any such public agency or legal entity, or both, have made a covenant or who are third-party beneficiaries of any such covenant.g. Provisions whereby any such public agency or legal

Any agent or agents designated in any such agreement shall be governed by the laws and rules applicable to such agent as a separate entity and not by any laws or rules which may be applicable to any of the other participating parties and not otherwise applicable to the agent.

(c) Any such legal entity may acquire services, output, capacity, energy, or any combination thereof only from:1. An electric project in which it has an ownership interest; or2. Any other source:a. To the extent of replacing the services, output, capacity, energy, or combination thereof of its share of an electric project when the output or capacity of such electric project is reduced or unavailable; orb. At any time and in any amount for resale to any of its members as necessary to meet their retail load requirements.However, under sub-subparagraph 2.b., such legal entity may not purchase wholesale power for resale to any of its members from any electric utility as a result of any legal proceeding commenced by the legal entity or any of its members after January 1, 1982, before any state or federal court or administrative body, to the extent that such purchase or proceeding would involuntarily expand the responsibility of the electric utility to provide such wholesale power.

(d) Any such legal entity may sell services, output, capacity, energy, or any combination thereof only to:1. Its members to meet their retail load requirements;2. Other electric utilities or foreign public utilities which have ownership interests in, or contractual arrangements which impose on such electric utilities or foreign public utilities obligations which are the economic equivalents of ownership interests in, the electric project from which such services, output, capacity, energy, or combination thereof is to be acquired;3. Any other electric utility or foreign public utility to dispose of services, output, capacity, energy, or any combination thereof that is surplus to the requirements of such legal entity:a. If such surplus results from default by one or more of the members of such legal entity under a contract or contracts for the purchase of such services, output, capacity, energy, or combination thereof; andb. If the revenues from such contract or contracts are pledged as security for payment of bonds or other evidences of indebtedness issued by such legal entity or if such revenues are required by such legal entity to meet its obligations under any contract or agreement entered into by such legal entity pursuant to paragraph (b);4. Any other electric utility or foreign public utility for a period not to exceed 5 years from the later to occur of the date of commercial operation of, or the date of acquisition by such legal entity of any ownership interest in or right to acquire services, output, capacity, energy, or any combination thereof from, the electric project from which such services, output, capacity, energy, or combination thereof is to be acquired, if:a. One or more members of such legal entity have contracted to purchase such services, output, capacity, energy, or combination thereof from such legal entity commencing upon the expiration of such period; andb. Such services, output, capacity, energy, or combination thereof, if acquired commencing at an earlier time, could have been reasonably predicted to create a surplus or surpluses in the electric system or systems of such member or members during such period, when added to services, output, capacity, energy, or any combination thereof available to such member or members during such period from facilities owned by such member or members or pursuant to one or more then-existing firm contractual obligations which are not terminable prior to the end of such period without payment of a penalty, or both; or5. Any combination of the above.Nothing contained in this paragraph shall prevent such legal entity from selling the output of its ownership interest in any such electric project to any electric utility or foreign public utility as emergency, scheduled maintenance, or economy interchange service.

(e) All obligations and covenants of any such public agency or legal entity, or both, contained in any contract or agreement, which contract or agreement and obligations and covenants are authorized, permitted, or contemplated by this section, shall be the legal, valid, and binding obligations and covenants of the public agency or legal entity undertaking such obligations or making such covenants; and each such obligation or covenant shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.

(f) When contract payments by any such public agency contracting with any such legal entity or revenues of any such public agency contracting with any other person or persons with respect to an electric project are to be pledged as security for the payment of bonds or other evidences of indebtedness sought to be validated, the complaint for validation may make parties defendant to such action, in addition to the state and the taxpayers, property owners, and citizens of the county in which the complaint for validation is filed, including nonresidents owning property or subject to taxation therein:1. Every public agency the contract payments of which are to be so pledged.2. Any other person contracting with such public agency or legal entity, or both, in any manner relating to such electric project, and particularly with relation to any ownership or operation of any electric project; the supplying of electrical energy to such public agency or legal entity, or both; or the taking or purchase of electrical energy from the electric project.3. The taxpayers, property owners, and citizens of each county or municipality in which each such public agency is located, including nonresidents owning property or subject to taxation therein, and the holders of any outstanding debt obligations of any such public agency or legal entity.All such parties who are made defendants and over whom the court acquires jurisdiction in such validation proceedings shall be required to show cause, if any exists, why such contract or agreement and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court, the validity of the terms thereof determined, and the matters and conditions which are imposed on the parties to such contract or agreement and all such undertakings thereof adjudicated to be valid and binding on the parties thereto. Notice of such proceedings shall be included in the notice of validation hearing required to be issued and published pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (7)(c); and a copy of the complaint in such proceedings, together with a copy of such notice, shall be served on each party defendant referred to in subparagraphs 1. and 2. who is made a defendant and over whom the court acquires jurisdiction in such validation proceedings. Any person resident of this state or any person not a resident of, or located within, this state, whether or not authorized to transact business in this state, who contracts with any such public agency or legal entity, or both, in any manner relating to such electric project, may intervene in the validation proceedings at or before the time set for the validation hearing and assert any ground or objection to the validity and binding effect of such contract or agreement on his or her own behalf and on behalf of any such public agency and of all citizens, residents, and property owners of the state. No appeal may be taken by any person who was not a party of record in such proceedings at the time the judgment appealed from was rendered. An adjudication as to the validity of any such contract or agreement from which no appeal has been taken within the time permitted by law from the date of entry of the judgment of validation or, if an appeal is filed, which is confirmed on appeal shall be forever conclusive and binding upon such legal entity and all such parties who are made defendants and over whom the court acquires jurisdiction in such validation proceedings.

(g) Each such public agency or legal entity, or both, which contracts with any other person or persons with respect to the ownership or operation of any electric project, and each such public agency which contracts with any legal entity for the support of, or supply of, power from an electric project, is authorized to pledge to such other person or persons or such legal entity, or both, for the benefit of such electric project all or any portion of the revenues derived or to be derived:1. In the case of any such public agency, from the ownership and operation of its electric or other integrated utility system; and2. In the case of a legal entity, from the provision of products and services by it;and to pledge to such other person or persons or such legal entity, or both, for the benefit of such electric project any securities, contract rights, and other property. Each such legal entity is also authorized to pledge to, or for the benefit of, the holders of any bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness issued by such legal entity, as security for the payment thereof, any revenues, securities, contract rights, or other property. Any such pledge shall specify the priority and ranking of such pledge in respect of other pledges, if any, of the same revenues, securities, contract rights, or other property by such public agency or legal entity. Any pledge of revenues, securities, contract rights, or other property made by any such public agency or legal entity, or both, pursuant to this section shall be valid and binding from the date the pledge is made. The revenues, securities, contract rights, or other property so pledged and then held or thereafter received by such public agency or legal entity, or any fiduciary, or such other person or persons shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act; and the lien of the pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, in contract, or otherwise against the public agency or legal entity making such pledge, without regard to whether such parties have notice thereof. The resolution, trust indenture, security agreement, or other instrument by which a pledge is created need not be filed or recorded in any manner.

(h) Any such legal entity is authorized and empowered to sue and be sued in its own name. In the event that any such public agency or legal entity enters into a contract or an agreement with respect to an electric project located in another state, or owns an interest in an electric project located in another state, an action against such public agency or legal entity may be brought in the federal or state courts located in such state.

(i) The provisions of this subsection shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes hereof. The powers conferred by the provisions of this subsection shall be in addition and supplementary to the powers conferred by the other provisions of this section, by any other general, local, or special law, or by any charter of any public agency. When the exercise of any power conferred on any public agency or any legal entity by the provisions of this subsection would conflict with any limitation or requirement upon such public agency or such legal entity contained in the other provisions of this section, in any other general, local, or special law, except s. 361.14, or in the charter of such public agency, such limitation or requirement shall be superseded by the provisions of this subsection for the purposes of the exercise of such power pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.

(j) While any bonds or other evidences of indebtedness issued by any such public agency or any such legal entity pursuant to the authority granted by paragraph (7)(c) or other applicable law remain outstanding, or while any such public agency or any such legal entity has any undischarged duties or obligations under any contract or agreement, including, but not limited to, obligations to any operator or joint owner of any electric project, the powers, duties, or existence of such public agency or such legal entity or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished, impaired, or affected in any manner which will affect materially and adversely the interests and rights of the owners of such bonds or other evidences of indebtedness or the persons to whom such duties or obligations are owed under such contract or agreement. The provisions of this subsection shall be for the benefit of the state, each such public agency, each such legal entity, every owner of the bonds of each such legal entity or public agency, and every other person to whom such public agency or such legal entity owes a duty or is obligated by contract or agreement; and, upon and after the earlier of the execution and delivery by any public agency or legal entity, pursuant to this section, of any contract or agreement to any person with respect to an electric project, or the issuance of such bonds or other evidences of indebtedness, the provisions of this subsection shall constitute an irrevocable contract by the state with the owners of the bonds or other evidences of indebtedness issued by such public agency or legal entity and with the other person or persons to whom any such public agency or legal entity owes a duty or is obligated by any such contract or agreement.

(k) The limitations on waiver in the provisions of s. 768.28 or any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, the Legislature, in accordance with s. 13, Art. X of the State Constitution, hereby declares that any such legal entity or any public agency of this state that participates in any electric project waives its sovereign immunity to:1. All other persons participating therein; and2. Any person in any manner contracting with a legal entity of which any such public agency is a member, with relation to:a. Ownership, operation, or any other activity set forth in sub-subparagraph (b)2.d. with relation to any electric project; orb. The supplying or purchasing of services, output, capacity, energy, or any combination thereof.

(l) Notwithstanding the definition of “electric project” contained in paragraph (3)(d), or any other provision of this subsection or of part II of chapter 361 limiting the parties which may participate jointly in electric projects, any public agency of this state which is an electric utility, or any separate legal entity created pursuant to the provisions of this section, the membership of which consists only of electric utilities, and which exercises or proposes to exercise the powers granted by part II of chapter 361, may exercise any or all of the powers provided in this subsection jointly with any other person with respect to the acquisition, extraction, conversion, use, transportation, storage, reprocessing, disposal, or any combination thereof of any primary fuel or source thereof, as well as any other materials resulting therefrom, only when such primary fuel or source thereof is to be used for the generation of electrical energy in one or more electric projects by such legal entity, any member thereof, or any combination thereof; and, in connection therewith, any such public agency or legal entity shall be deemed to have all the additional powers, privileges, and rights provided in this subsection.

(m) In the event that any public agency or any such legal entity, or both, should receive, in connection with its joint ownership or right to the services, output, capacity, or energy of an electric project, as defined in paragraph (3)(d), any material which is designated by the person supplying such material as proprietary confidential business information or which a court of competent jurisdiction has designated as confidential or secret shall be kept confidential and shall be exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1). As used in this paragraph, “proprietary confidential business information” includes, but is not limited to, trade secrets; internal auditing controls and reports of internal auditors; security measures, systems, or procedures; information concerning bids or other contractual data, the disclosure of which would impair the efforts of the utility to contract for services on favorable terms; employee personnel information unrelated to compensation, duties, qualifications, or responsibilities; and formulas, patterns, devices, combinations of devices, contract costs, or other information the disclosure of which would injure the affected entity in the marketplace.

(16)(a) All of the additional powers and authority granted by chapter 82-53, Laws of Florida, to a public agency as defined in paragraph (3)(b), a legal entity created pursuant to the provisions of this section, or both, respecting agreements for participation in electric projects shall apply to any agreement in existence as of March 25, 1982, as well as to any such agreement entered into thereafter; but no additional limitation provided in chapter 82-53 upon any power or authority of any such public agency or legal entity, or both, respecting agreements for participation in electric projects shall apply to any such agreement entered into prior to March 25, 1982.

"(a) The comprehensive plan shall consist of elements as described in this section, and may include optional elements.

(b) A local government may include, as part of its adopted plan, documents adopted by reference but not incorporated verbatim into the plan. The adoption by reference must identify the title and author of the document and indicate clearly what provisions and edition of the document is being adopted.

(c) The format of these principles and guidelines is at the discretion of the local government, but typically is expressed in goals, objectives, policies, and strategies.

(d) The comprehensive plan shall identify procedures for monitoring, evaluating, and appraising implementation of the plan.

(e) When a federal, state, or regional agency has implemented a regulatory program, a local government is not required to duplicate or exceed that regulatory program in its local comprehensive plan.

(f) All mandatory and optional elements of the comprehensive plan and plan amendments shall be based upon relevant and appropriate data and an analysis by the local government that may include, but not be limited to, surveys, studies, community goals and vision, and other data available at the time of adoption of the comprehensive plan or plan amendment. To be based on data means to react to it in an appropriate way and to the extent necessary indicated by the data available on that particular subject at the time of adoption of the plan or plan amendment at issue.1. Surveys, studies, and data utilized in the preparation of the comprehensive plan may not be deemed a part of the comprehensive plan unless adopted as a part of it. Copies of such studies, surveys, data, and supporting documents for proposed plans and plan amendments shall be made available for public inspection, and copies of such plans shall be made available to the public upon payment of reasonable charges for reproduction. Support data or summaries are not subject to the compliance review process, but the comprehensive plan must be clearly based on appropriate data. Support data or summaries may be used to aid in the determination of compliance and consistency.2. Data must be taken from professionally accepted sources. The application of a methodology utilized in data collection or whether a particular methodology is professionally accepted may be evaluated. However, the evaluation may not include whether one accepted methodology is better than another. Original data collection by local governments is not required. However, local governments may use original data so long as methodologies are professionally accepted.3. The comprehensive plan shall be based upon permanent and seasonal population estimates and projections, which shall either be those published by the Office of Economic and Demographic Research or generated by the local government based upon a professionally acceptable methodology. The plan must be based on at least the minimum amount of land required to accommodate the medium projections as published by the Office of Economic and Demographic Research for at least a 10-year planning period unless otherwise limited under s. 380.05, including related rules of the Administration Commission. Absent physical limitations on population growth, population projections for each municipality, and the unincorporated area within a county must, at a minimum, be reflective of each area’s proportional share of the total county population and the total county population growth.

(3)(a) The comprehensive plan must contain a capital improvements element designed to consider the need for and the location of public facilities in order to encourage the efficient use of such facilities and set forth all of the following:1. A component that outlines principles for construction, extension, or increase in capacity of public facilities, as well as a component that outlines principles for correcting existing public facility deficiencies, which are necessary to implement the comprehensive plan. The components must cover at least a 5-year period.2. Estimated public facility costs, including a delineation of when facilities will be needed, the general location of the facilities, and projected revenue sources to fund the facilities.3. Standards to ensure the availability of public facilities and the adequacy of those facilities to meet established acceptable levels of service.4. A schedule of capital improvements which includes any publicly funded projects of federal, state, or local government, and which may include privately funded projects for which the local government has no fiscal responsibility. Projects necessary to ensure that any adopted level-of-service standards are achieved and maintained for the 5-year period must be identified as either funded or unfunded and given a level of priority for funding. The schedule must:a. Include transportation improvements included in the applicable metropolitan planning organization’s transportation improvement program adopted pursuant to s. 339.175(8) to the extent that such improvements are relied upon to ensure concurrency and financial feasibility;b. Where applicable, include a list of projects necessary to achieve the pollutant load reductions attributable to the local government, as established in a basin management action plan pursuant to s. 403.067(7); andc. Be coordinated with the applicable metropolitan planning organization’s long-range transportation plan adopted pursuant to s. 339.175(7).

(b) The capital improvements element must be reviewed by the local government on an annual basis. Modifications to update the 5-year capital improvement schedule may be accomplished by ordinance and may not be deemed to be amendments to the local comprehensive plan.

(4)(a) Coordination of the local comprehensive plan with the comprehensive plans of adjacent municipalities, the county, adjacent counties, or the region; with the appropriate water management district’s regional water supply plans approved pursuant to s. 373.709; and with adopted rules pertaining to designated areas of critical state concern shall be a major objective of the local comprehensive planning process. To that end, in the preparation of a comprehensive plan or element thereof, and in the comprehensive plan or element as adopted, the governing body shall include a specific policy statement indicating the relationship of the proposed development of the area to the comprehensive plans of adjacent municipalities, the county, adjacent counties, or the region, as the case may require and as such adopted plans or plans in preparation may exist.

(b) When all or a portion of the land in a local government jurisdiction is or becomes part of a designated area of critical state concern, the local government shall clearly identify those portions of the local comprehensive plan that shall be applicable to the critical area and shall indicate the relationship of the proposed development of the area to the rules for the area of critical state concern.

(5)(a) Each local government comprehensive plan must include at least two planning periods, one covering at least the first 10-year period occurring after the plan’s adoption and one covering at least a 20-year period. Additional planning periods for specific components, elements, land use amendments, or projects shall be permissible and accepted as part of the planning process.

(b) The comprehensive plan and its elements shall contain guidelines or policies for the implementation of the plan and its elements.

(a) A future land use plan element designating proposed future general distribution, location, and extent of the uses of land for residential uses, commercial uses, industry, agriculture, recreation, conservation, education, public facilities, and other categories of the public and private uses of land. The approximate acreage and the general range of density or intensity of use shall be provided for the gross land area included in each existing land use category. The element shall establish the long-term end toward which land use programs and activities are ultimately directed.1. Each future land use category must be defined in terms of uses included, and must include standards to be followed in the control and distribution of population densities and building and structure intensities. The proposed distribution, location, and extent of the various categories of land use shall be shown on a land use map or map series which shall be supplemented by goals, policies, and measurable objectives.2. The future land use plan and plan amendments shall be based upon surveys, studies, and data regarding the area, as applicable, including:a. The amount of land required to accommodate anticipated growth.b. The projected permanent and seasonal population of the area.c. The character of undeveloped land.d. The availability of water supplies, public facilities, and services.e. The need for redevelopment, including the renewal of blighted areas and the elimination of nonconforming uses which are inconsistent with the character of the community.f. The compatibility of uses on lands adjacent to or closely proximate to military installations.g. The compatibility of uses on lands adjacent to an airport as defined in s. 330.35 and consistent with s. 333.02.h. The discouragement of urban sprawl.i. The need for job creation, capital investment, and economic development that will strengthen and diversify the community’s economy.j. The need to modify land uses and development patterns within antiquated subdivisions.3. The future land use plan element shall include criteria to be used to:a. Achieve the compatibility of lands adjacent or closely proximate to military installations, considering factors identified in s. 163.3175(5).b. Achieve the compatibility of lands adjacent to an airport as defined in s. 330.35 and consistent with s. 333.02.c. Encourage preservation of recreational and commercial working waterfronts for water-dependent uses in coastal communities.d. Encourage the location of schools proximate to urban residential areas to the extent possible.e. Coordinate future land uses with the topography and soil conditions, and the availability of facilities and services.f. Ensure the protection of natural and historic resources.g. Provide for the compatibility of adjacent land uses.h. Provide guidelines for the implementation of mixed-use development including the types of uses allowed, the percentage distribution among the mix of uses, or other standards, and the density and intensity of each use.4. The amount of land designated for future planned uses shall provide a balance of uses that foster vibrant, viable communities and economic development opportunities and address outdated development patterns, such as antiquated subdivisions. The amount of land designated for future land uses should allow the operation of real estate markets to provide adequate choices for permanent and seasonal residents and business and may not be limited solely by the projected population. The element shall accommodate at least the minimum amount of land required to accommodate the medium projections as published by the Office of Economic and Demographic Research for at least a 10-year planning period unless otherwise limited under s. 380.05, including related rules of the Administration Commission.5. The future land use plan of a county may designate areas for possible future municipal incorporation.6. The land use maps or map series shall generally identify and depict historic district boundaries and shall designate historically significant properties meriting protection.7. The future land use element must clearly identify the land use categories in which public schools are an allowable use. When delineating the land use categories in which public schools are an allowable use, a local government shall include in the categories sufficient land proximate to residential development to meet the projected needs for schools in coordination with public school boards and may establish differing criteria for schools of different type or size. Each local government shall include lands contiguous to existing school sites, to the maximum extent possible, within the land use categories in which public schools are an allowable use.8. Future land use map amendments shall be based upon the following analyses:a. An analysis of the availability of facilities and services.b. An analysis of the suitability of the plan amendment for its proposed use considering the character of the undeveloped land, soils, topography, natural resources, and historic resources on site.c. An analysis of the minimum amount of land needed to achieve the goals and requirements of this section.9. The future land use element and any amendment to the future land use element shall discourage the proliferation of urban sprawl.a. The primary indicators that a plan or plan amendment does not discourage the proliferation of urban sprawl are listed below. The evaluation of the presence of these indicators shall consist of an analysis of the plan or plan amendment within the context of features and characteristics unique to each locality in order to determine whether the plan or plan amendment:(I) Promotes, allows, or designates for development substantial areas of the jurisdiction to develop as low-intensity, low-density, or single-use development or uses.(II) Promotes, allows, or designates significant amounts of urban development to occur in rural areas at substantial distances from existing urban areas while not using undeveloped lands that are available and suitable for development.(III) Promotes, allows, or designates urban development in radial, strip, isolated, or ribbon patterns generally emanating from existing urban developments.(IV) Fails to adequately protect and conserve natural resources, such as wetlands, floodplains, native vegetation, environmentally sensitive areas, natural groundwater aquifer recharge areas, lakes, rivers, shorelines, beaches, bays, estuarine systems, and other significant natural systems.(V) Fails to adequately protect adjacent agricultural areas and activities, including silviculture, active agricultural and silvicultural activities, passive agricultural activities, and dormant, unique, and prime farmlands and soils.(VI) Fails to maximize use of existing public facilities and services.(VII) Fails to maximize use of future public facilities and services.(VIII) Allows for land use patterns or timing which disproportionately increase the cost in time, money, and energy of providing and maintaining facilities and services, including roads, potable water, sanitary sewer, stormwater management, law enforcement, education, health care, fire and emergency response, and general government.(IX) Fails to provide a clear separation between rural and urban uses.(X) Discourages or inhibits infill development or the redevelopment of existing neighborhoods and communities.(XI) Fails to encourage a functional mix of uses.(XII) Results in poor accessibility among linked or related land uses.(XIII) Results in the loss of significant amounts of functional open space.b. The future land use element or plan amendment shall be determined to discourage the proliferation of urban sprawl if it incorporates a development pattern or urban form that achieves four or more of the following:(I) Directs or locates economic growth and associated land development to geographic areas of the community in a manner that does not have an adverse impact on and protects natural resources and ecosystems.(II) Promotes the efficient and cost-effective provision or extension of public infrastructure and services.(III) Promotes walkable and connected communities and provides for compact development and a mix of uses at densities and intensities that will support a range of housing choices and a multimodal transportation system, including pedestrian, bicycle, and transit, if available.(IV) Promotes conservation of water and energy.(V) Preserves agricultural areas and activities, including silviculture, and dormant, unique, and prime farmlands and soils.(VI) Preserves open space and natural lands and provides for public open space and recreation needs.(VII) Creates a balance of land uses based upon demands of the residential population for the nonresidential needs of an area.(VIII) Provides uses, densities, and intensities of use and urban form that would remediate an existing or planned development pattern in the vicinity that constitutes sprawl or if it provides for an innovative development pattern such as transit-oriented developments or new towns as defined in s. 163.3164.10. The future land use element shall include a future land use map or map series.a. The proposed distribution, extent, and location of the following uses shall be shown on the future land use map or map series:(I) Residential.(II) Commercial.(III) Industrial.(IV) Agricultural.(V) Recreational.(VI) Conservation.(VII) Educational.(VIII) Public.b. The following areas shall also be shown on the future land use map or map series, if applicable:(I) Historic district boundaries and designated historically significant properties.(II) Transportation concurrency management area boundaries or transportation concurrency exception area boundaries.(III) Multimodal transportation district boundaries.(IV) Mixed-use categories.c. The following natural resources or conditions shall be shown on the future land use map or map series, if applicable:(I) Existing and planned public potable waterwells, cones of influence, and wellhead protection areas.(II) Beaches and shores, including estuarine systems.(III) Rivers, bays, lakes, floodplains, and harbors.(IV) Wetlands.(V) Minerals and soils.(VI) Coastal high hazard areas.

(b) A transportation element addressing mobility issues in relationship to the size and character of the local government. The purpose of the transportation element shall be to plan for a multimodal transportation system that places emphasis on public transportation systems, where feasible. The element shall provide for a safe, convenient multimodal transportation system, coordinated with the future land use map or map series and designed to support all elements of the comprehensive plan. A local government that has all or part of its jurisdiction included within the metropolitan planning area of a metropolitan planning organization (M.P.O.) pursuant to s. 339.175 shall prepare and adopt a transportation element consistent with this subsection. Local governments that are not located within the metropolitan planning area of an M.P.O. shall address traffic circulation, mass transit, and ports, and aviation and related facilities consistent with this subsection, except that local governments with a population of 50,000 or less shall only be required to address transportation circulation. The element shall be coordinated with the plans and programs of any applicable metropolitan planning organization, transportation authority, Florida Transportation Plan, and Department of Transportation adopted work program.1. Each local government’s transportation element shall address traffic circulation, including the types, locations, and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares and transportation routes, including bicycle and pedestrian ways. Transportation corridors, as defined in s. 334.03, may be designated in the transportation element pursuant to s. 337.273. If the transportation corridors are designated, the local government may adopt a transportation corridor management ordinance. The element shall include a map or map series showing the general location of the existing and proposed transportation system features and shall be coordinated with the future land use map or map series. The element shall reflect the data, analysis, and associated principles and strategies relating to:a. The existing transportation system levels of service and system needs and the availability of transportation facilities and services.b. The growth trends and travel patterns and interactions between land use and transportation.c. Existing and projected intermodal deficiencies and needs.d. The projected transportation system levels of service and system needs based upon the future land use map and the projected integrated transportation system.e. How the local government will correct existing facility deficiencies, meet the identified needs of the projected transportation system, and advance the purpose of this paragraph and the other elements of the comprehensive plan.2. Local governments within a metropolitan planning area designated as an M.P.O. pursuant to s. 339.175 shall also address:a. All alternative modes of travel, such as public transportation, pedestrian, and bicycle travel.b. Aviation, rail, seaport facilities, access to those facilities, and intermodal terminals.c. The capability to evacuate the coastal population before an impending natural disaster.d. Airports, projected airport and aviation development, and land use compatibility around airports, which includes areas defined in ss. 333.01 and 333.02.e. An identification of land use densities, building intensities, and transportation management programs to promote public transportation systems in designated public transportation corridors so as to encourage population densities sufficient to support such systems.3. Municipalities having populations greater than 50,000, and counties having populations greater than 75,000, shall include mass-transit provisions showing proposed methods for the moving of people, rights-of-way, terminals, and related facilities and shall address:a. The provision of efficient public transit services based upon existing and proposed major trip generators and attractors, safe and convenient public transit terminals, land uses, and accommodation of the special needs of the transportation disadvantaged.b. Plans for port, aviation, and related facilities coordinated with the general circulation and transportation element.c. Plans for the circulation of recreational traffic, including bicycle facilities, exercise trails, riding facilities, and such other matters as may be related to the improvement and safety of movement of all types of recreational traffic.4. At the option of a local government, an airport master plan, and any subsequent amendments to the airport master plan, prepared by a licensed publicly owned and operated airport under s. 333.06 may be incorporated into the local government comprehensive plan by the local government having jurisdiction under this act for the area in which the airport or projected airport development is located by the adoption of a comprehensive plan amendment. In the amendment to the local comprehensive plan that integrates the airport master plan, the comprehensive plan amendment shall address land use compatibility consistent with chapter 333 regarding airport zoning; the provision of regional transportation facilities for the efficient use and operation of the transportation system and airport; consistency with the local government transportation circulation element and applicable M.P.O. long-range transportation plans; the execution of any necessary interlocal agreements for the purposes of the provision of public facilities and services to maintain the adopted level-of-service standards for facilities subject to concurrency; and may address airport-related or aviation-related development. Development or expansion of an airport consistent with the adopted airport master plan that has been incorporated into the local comprehensive plan in compliance with this part, and airport-related or aviation-related development that has been addressed in the comprehensive plan amendment that incorporates the airport master plan, do not constitute a development of regional impact. Notwithstanding any other general law, an airport that has received a development-of-regional-impact development order pursuant to s. 380.06, but which is no longer required to undergo development-of-regional-impact review pursuant to this subsection, may rescind its development-of-regional-impact order upon written notification to the applicable local government. Upon receipt by the local government, the development-of-regional-impact development order shall be deemed rescinded.

(c) A general sanitary sewer, solid waste, drainage, potable water, and natural groundwater aquifer recharge element correlated to principles and guidelines for future land use, indicating ways to provide for future potable water, drainage, sanitary sewer, solid waste, and aquifer recharge protection requirements for the area. The element may be a detailed engineering plan including a topographic map depicting areas of prime groundwater recharge.1. Each local government shall address in the data and analyses required by this section those facilities that provide service within the local government’s jurisdiction. Local governments that provide facilities to serve areas within other local government jurisdictions shall also address those facilities in the data and analyses required by this section, using data from the comprehensive plan for those areas for the purpose of projecting facility needs as required in this subsection. For shared facilities, each local government shall indicate the proportional capacity of the systems allocated to serve its jurisdiction.2. The element must describe the problems and needs and the general facilities that will be required for solution of the problems and needs, including correcting existing facility deficiencies. The element must address coordinating the extension of, increase in the capacity of, or upgrade in treatment of facilities to meet future needs; prioritizing advanced waste treatment while maximizing the use of existing facilities and discouraging urban sprawl; conserving potable water resources; and protecting the functions of natural groundwater recharge areas and natural drainage features.3. Within the local government’s jurisdiction, for any development of more than 50 residential lots, whether built or unbuilt, with more than one onsite sewage treatment and disposal system per 1 acre, the element must consider the feasibility of providing sanitary sewer services within a 10-year planning horizon and must identify the name and location of the wastewater facility that could receive sanitary sewer flows after connection; the capacity of the facility and any associated transmission facilities; the projected wastewater flow at that facility for the next 20 years, including expected future new construction and connections of onsite sewage treatment and disposal systems to sanitary sewer; and a timeline for the construction of the sanitary sewer system. An onsite sewage treatment and disposal system is presumed to exist on a parcel if sanitary sewer services are not available at or adjacent to the parcel boundary. Each comprehensive plan must be updated to include this element by July 1, 2024, and as needed thereafter to account for future applicable developments. This subparagraph does not apply to a local government designated as a rural area of opportunity under s. 288.0656.4. Within 18 months after the governing board approves an updated regional water supply plan, the element must incorporate the alternative water supply project or projects selected by the local government from those identified in the regional water supply plan pursuant to s. 373.709(2)(a) or proposed by the local government under s. 373.709(8)(b). If a local government is located within two water management districts, the local government must adopt its comprehensive plan amendment within 18 months after the later updated regional water supply plan. The element must identify such alternative water supply projects and traditional water supply projects and conservation and reuse necessary to meet the water needs identified in s. 373.709(2)(a) within the local government’s jurisdiction and include a work plan, covering at least a 10-year planning period, for building public, private, and regional water supply facilities, including development of alternative water supplies, which are identified in the element as necessary to serve existing and new development. The work plan must be updated, at a minimum, every 5 years within 18 months after the governing board of a water management district approves an updated regional water supply plan. Local governments, public and private utilities, regional water supply authorities, special districts, and water management districts are encouraged to cooperatively plan for the development of multijurisdictional water supply facilities that are sufficient to meet projected demands for established planning periods, including the development of alternative water sources to supplement traditional sources of groundwater and surface water supplies.5. A local government that does not own, operate, or maintain its own water supply facilities, including, but not limited to, wells, treatment facilities, and distribution infrastructure, and is served by a public water utility with a permitted allocation of greater than 300 million gallons per day is not required to amend its comprehensive plan in response to an updated regional water supply plan or to maintain a work plan if any such local government’s usage of water constitutes less than 1 percent of the public water utility’s total permitted allocation. However, any such local government shall cooperate with, and provide relevant data to, any local government or utility provider that provides service within its jurisdiction, and shall keep its general sanitary sewer, solid waste, potable water, and natural groundwater aquifer recharge element updated in accordance with s. 163.3191.

The area of concern for counties shall include all municipalities within the county, adjacent counties, and adjacent municipalities.b. Ensure coordination in establishing level of service standards for public facilities with any state, regional, or local entity having operational and maintenance responsibility for such facilities.

(i)1. In accordance with the legislative intent expressed in ss. 163.3161(10) and 187.101(3) that governmental entities respect judicially acknowledged and constitutionally protected private property rights, each local government shall include in its comprehensive plan a property rights element to ensure that private property rights are considered in local decisionmaking. A local government may adopt its own property rights element or use the following statement of rights:The following rights shall be considered in local decisionmaking:1. The right of a property owner to physically possess and control his or her interests in the property, including easements, leases, or mineral rights.2. The right of a property owner to use, maintain, develop, and improve his or her property for personal use or for the use of any other person, subject to state law and local ordinances.3. The right of the property owner to privacy and to exclude others from the property to protect the owner’s possessions and property.4. The right of a property owner to dispose of his or her property through sale or gift.2. Each local government must adopt a property rights element in its comprehensive plan by the earlier of the date of its adoption of its next proposed plan amendment that is initiated after July 1, 2021, or the date of the next scheduled evaluation and appraisal of its comprehensive plan pursuant to s. 163.3191. If a local government adopts its own property rights element, the element may not conflict with the statement of rights provided in subparagraph 1.

(7)(a) The Legislature finds that:1. There are a number of rural agricultural industrial centers in the state that process, produce, or aid in the production or distribution of a variety of agriculturally based products, including, but not limited to, fruits, vegetables, timber, and other crops, and juices, paper, and building materials. Rural agricultural industrial centers have a significant amount of existing associated infrastructure that is used for processing, producing, or distributing agricultural products.2. Such rural agricultural industrial centers are often located within or near communities in which the economy is largely dependent upon agriculture and agriculturally based products. The centers significantly enhance the economy of such communities. However, these agriculturally based communities are often socioeconomically challenged and designated as rural areas of opportunity. If such rural agricultural industrial centers are lost and not replaced with other job-creating enterprises, the agriculturally based communities will lose a substantial amount of their economies.3. The state has a compelling interest in preserving the viability of agriculture and protecting rural agricultural communities and the state from the economic upheaval that would result from short-term or long-term adverse changes in the agricultural economy. To protect these communities and promote viable agriculture for the long term, it is essential to encourage and permit diversification of existing rural agricultural industrial centers by providing for jobs that are not solely dependent upon, but are compatible with and complement, existing agricultural industrial operations and to encourage the creation and expansion of industries that use agricultural products in innovative ways. However, the expansion and diversification of these existing centers must be accomplished in a manner that does not promote urban sprawl into surrounding agricultural and rural areas.

(b) As used in this subsection, the term “rural agricultural industrial center” means a developed parcel of land in an unincorporated area on which there exists an operating agricultural industrial facility or facilities that employ at least 200 full-time employees in the aggregate and process and prepare for transport a farm product, as defined in s. 163.3162, or any biomass material that could be used, directly or indirectly, for the production of fuel, renewable energy, bioenergy, or alternative fuel as defined by law. The center may also include land contiguous to the facility site which is not used for the cultivation of crops, but on which other existing activities essential to the operation of such facility or facilities are located or conducted. The parcel of land must be located within, or within 10 miles of, a rural area of opportunity.

(c)1. A landowner whose land is located within a rural agricultural industrial center may apply for an amendment to the local government comprehensive plan for the purpose of designating and expanding the existing agricultural industrial uses of facilities located within the center or expanding the existing center to include industrial uses or facilities that are not dependent upon but are compatible with agriculture and the existing uses and facilities. A local government comprehensive plan amendment under this paragraph must:a. Not increase the physical area of the existing rural agricultural industrial center by more than 50 percent or 320 acres, whichever is greater.b. Propose a project that would, upon completion, create at least 50 new full-time jobs.c. Demonstrate that sufficient infrastructure capacity exists or will be provided to support the expanded center at the level-of-service standards adopted in the local government comprehensive plan.d. Contain goals, objectives, and policies that will ensure that any adverse environmental impacts of the expanded center will be adequately addressed and mitigation implemented or demonstrate that the local government comprehensive plan contains such provisions.2. Within 6 months after receiving an application as provided in this paragraph, the local government shall transmit the application to the state land planning agency for review pursuant to this chapter together with any needed amendments to the applicable sections of its comprehensive plan to include goals, objectives, and policies that provide for the expansion of rural agricultural industrial centers and discourage urban sprawl in the surrounding areas. Such goals, objectives, and policies must promote and be consistent with the findings in this subsection. An amendment that meets the requirements of this subsection is presumed not to be urban sprawl as defined in s. 163.3164 and shall be considered within 90 days after any review required by the state land planning agency if required by s. 163.3184. This presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.

(d) This subsection does not apply to an optional sector plan adopted pursuant to s. 163.3245, a rural land stewardship area designated pursuant to s. 163.3248, or any comprehensive plan amendment that includes an inland port terminal or affiliated port development.

(e) This subsection does not confer the status of rural area of opportunity, or any of the rights or benefits derived from such status, on any land area not otherwise designated as such pursuant to s. 288.0656(7).

"(1)(a) The Legislature finds that floating solar facilities, also known as “floatovoltaics,” can be effective tools in harnessing energy in bodies of water that have been permitted for storage.

(b) The Legislature finds that siting floating solar facilities on wastewater treatment ponds, abandoned limerock mine areas, stormwater treatment ponds, reclaimed water ponds, and other water storage reservoirs are beneficial uses of those areas for many reasons, including the fact that the water has a cooling effect on the solar panels, which can boost power production, and the fact that the panels help decrease the amount of water lost to evaporation and the formation of harmful algal blooms.

(c) Therefore, the Legislature finds that the siting of floating solar facilities should be encouraged by local governments as appropriate uses of water and land areas.

Any person making a sale for resale may, through an informal protest provided in s. 213.21 and the rules of the Department of Revenue, provide the department with evidence of the exempt status of a sale. The department shall adopt rules that provide that valid proof and documentation of the resale by a person making the sale for resale will be accepted by the department when submitted during the protest period but will not be accepted when submitted in any proceeding under chapter 120 or any circuit court action instituted under chapter 72;

The certification must include an acknowledgment by the purchaser that it will be liable for tax pursuant to paragraph (1)(f) if the requirements for exclusion are not met.

The term “government contractor” includes prime contractors and subcontractors. As used in this paragraph, a cost is a “direct item of cost” if it is a “direct cost” as defined in 48 C.F.R. s. 9904.418-30(a)(2), or similar successor provisions, including costs identified specifically with a particular contract.

The terms do not include the sale, use, storage, or consumption of industrial materials, including chemicals and fuels except as provided herein, for future processing, manufacture, or conversion into articles of tangible personal property for resale when such industrial materials, including chemicals and fuels except as provided herein, become a component or ingredient of the finished product. However, the terms include the sale, use, storage, or consumption of tangible personal property, including machinery and equipment or parts thereof, purchased electricity, and fuels used to power machinery, when such items are used and dissipated in fabricating, converting, or processing tangible personal property for sale, even though they may become ingredients or components of the tangible personal property for sale through accident, wear, tear, erosion, corrosion, or similar means. The terms do not include the sale of materials to a registered repair facility for use in repairing a motor vehicle, airplane, or boat, when such materials are incorporated into and sold as part of the repair. Such a sale shall be deemed a purchase for resale by the repair facility, even though every material is not separately stated or separately priced on the repair invoice.

(d) “Gross sales” means the sum total of all sales of tangible personal property as defined herein, without any deduction whatsoever of any kind or character, except as provided in this chapter.

(e) The term “retail sale” includes a remote sale as defined in s. 212.0596(1).

For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “utility” means any person providing utility services as defined in s. 203.012. This exception also applies to property, wherever located, on which the following are placed: towers, antennas, cables, accessory structures, or equipment, not including switching equipment, used in the provision of mobile communications services as defined in s. 202.11. For purposes of this chapter, towers used in the provision of mobile communications services, as defined in s. 202.11, are considered to be fixtures.6. A public street or road which is used for transportation purposes.7. Property used at an airport exclusively for the purpose of aircraft landing or aircraft taxiing or property used by an airline for the purpose of loading or unloading passengers or property onto or from aircraft or for fueling aircraft.8.a. Property used at a port authority, as defined in s. 315.02(2), exclusively for the purpose of oceangoing vessels or tugs docking, or such vessels mooring on property used by a port authority for the purpose of loading or unloading passengers or cargo onto or from such a vessel, or property used at a port authority for fueling such vessels, or to the extent that the amount paid for the use of any property at the port is based on the charge for the amount of tonnage actually imported or exported through the port by a tenant.b. The amount charged for the use of any property at the port in excess of the amount charged for tonnage actually imported or exported shall remain subject to tax except as provided in sub-subparagraph a.9. Property used as an integral part of the performance of qualified production services.

As used in this subparagraph, “space flight business” means the manufacturing, processing, or assembly of a space facility, space propulsion system, space vehicle, satellite, or station of any kind possessing the capacity for space flight, as defined by s. 212.02(23), or components thereof, and also means the following activities supporting space flight: vehicle launch activities, flight operations, ground control or ground support, and all administrative activities directly related thereto. Property shall be deemed to be used or occupied predominantly for space flight business purposes if more than 50 percent of the property, or improvements thereon, is used for one or more space flight business purposes. Possession by a landlord, lessor, or licensor of a signed written statement from the tenant, lessee, or licensee claiming the exemption shall relieve the landlord, lessor, or licensor from the responsibility of collecting the tax, and the department shall look solely to the tenant, lessee, or licensee for recovery of such tax if it determines that the exemption was not applicable.13. Rented, leased, subleased, or licensed to a person providing telecommunications, data systems management, or Internet services at a publicly or privately owned convention hall, civic center, or meeting space at a public lodging establishment as defined in s. 509.013. This subparagraph applies only to that portion of the rental, lease, or license payment that is based upon a percentage of sales, revenue sharing, or royalty payments and not based upon a fixed price. This subparagraph is intended to be clarifying and remedial in nature and shall apply retroactively. This subparagraph does not provide a basis for an assessment of any tax not paid, or create a right to a refund of any tax paid, pursuant to this section before July 1, 2010.

(b) When a lease involves multiple use of real property wherein a part of the real property is subject to the tax herein, and a part of the property would be excluded from the tax under subparagraph (a)1., subparagraph (a)2., subparagraph (a)3., or subparagraph (a)5., the department shall determine, from the lease or license and such other information as may be available, that portion of the total rental charge which is exempt from the tax imposed by this section. The portion of the premises leased or rented by a for-profit entity providing a residential facility for the aged will be exempt on the basis of a pro rata portion calculated by combining the square footage of the areas used for residential units by the aged and for the care of such residents and dividing the resultant sum by the total square footage of the rented premises. For purposes of this section, the term “residential facility for the aged” means a facility that is licensed or certified in whole or in part under chapter 400, chapter 429, or chapter 651; or that provides residences to the elderly and is financed by a mortgage or loan made or insured by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development under s. 202, s. 202 with a s. 8 subsidy, s. 221(d)(3) or (4), s. 232, or s. 236 of the National Housing Act; or other such similar facility that provides residences primarily for the elderly.

1(c) For the exercise of such privilege, a tax is levied at the rate of 2.0 percent of and on the total rent or license fee charged for such real property by the person charging or collecting the rental or license fee. The total rent or license fee charged for such real property shall include payments for the granting of a privilege to use or occupy real property for any purpose and shall include base rent, percentage rents, or similar charges. Such charges shall be included in the total rent or license fee subject to tax under this section whether or not they can be attributed to the ability of the lessor’s or licensor’s property as used or operated to attract customers. Payments for intrinsically valuable personal property such as franchises, trademarks, service marks, logos, or patents are not subject to tax under this section. In the case of a contractual arrangement that provides for both payments taxable as total rent or license fee and payments not subject to tax, the tax shall be based on a reasonable allocation of such payments and shall not apply to that portion which is for the nontaxable payments.

1(d) If the rental or license fee of any such real property is paid by way of property, goods, wares, merchandise, services, or other thing of value, the tax shall be at the rate of 2.0 percent of the value of the property, goods, wares, merchandise, services, or other thing of value.

(e) The tax rate in effect at the time that the tenant or person occupies, uses, or is entitled to occupy or use the real property is the tax rate applicable to the transaction taxable under this section, regardless of when a rent or license fee payment is due or paid. The applicable tax rate may not be avoided by delaying or accelerating rent or license fee payments.

(2)(a) The tenant or person actually occupying, using, or entitled to the use of any property from which the rental or license fee is subject to taxation under this section shall pay the tax to his or her immediate landlord or other person granting the right to such tenant or person to occupy or use such real property.

(b) It is the further intent of this Legislature that only one tax be collected on the rental or license fee payable for the occupancy or use of any such property, that the tax so collected shall not be pyramided by a progression of transactions, and that the amount of the tax due the state shall not be decreased by any such progression of transactions.

"1(a)1.a. At the rate of 6 percent of the sales price of each item or article of tangible personal property when sold at retail in this state, computed on each taxable sale for the purpose of remitting the amount of tax due the state, and including each and every retail sale.b. Each occasional or isolated sale of an aircraft, boat, mobile home, or motor vehicle of a class or type which is required to be registered, licensed, titled, or documented in this state or by the United States Government shall be subject to tax at the rate provided in this paragraph. The department shall by rule adopt any nationally recognized publication for valuation of used motor vehicles as the reference price list for any used motor vehicle which is required to be licensed pursuant to s. 320.08(1), (2), (3)(a), (b), (c), or (e), or (9). If any party to an occasional or isolated sale of such a vehicle reports to the tax collector a sales price which is less than 80 percent of the average loan price for the specified model and year of such vehicle as listed in the most recent reference price list, the tax levied under this paragraph shall be computed by the department on such average loan price unless the parties to the sale have provided to the tax collector an affidavit signed by each party, or other substantial proof, stating the actual sales price. Any party to such sale who reports a sales price less than the actual sales price is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. The department shall collect or attempt to collect from such party any delinquent sales taxes. In addition, such party shall pay any tax due and any penalty and interest assessed plus a penalty equal to twice the amount of the additional tax owed. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Department of Revenue may waive or compromise any penalty imposed pursuant to this subparagraph.2. This paragraph does not apply to the sale of a boat or aircraft by or through a registered dealer under this chapter to a purchaser who, at the time of taking delivery, is a nonresident of this state, does not make his or her permanent place of abode in this state, and is not engaged in carrying on in this state any employment, trade, business, or profession in which the boat or aircraft will be used in this state, or is a corporation none of the officers or directors of which is a resident of, or makes his or her permanent place of abode in, this state, or is a noncorporate entity that has no individual vested with authority to participate in the management, direction, or control of the entity’s affairs who is a resident of, or makes his or her permanent abode in, this state. For purposes of this exemption, either a registered dealer acting on his or her own behalf as seller, a registered dealer acting as broker on behalf of a seller, or a registered dealer acting as broker on behalf of the nonresident purchaser may be deemed to be the selling dealer. This exemption is not allowed unless:a. The nonresident purchaser removes a qualifying boat, as described in sub-subparagraph f., from this state within 90 days after the date of purchase or extension, or the nonresident purchaser removes a nonqualifying boat or an aircraft from this state within 10 days after the date of purchase or, when the boat or aircraft is repaired or altered, within 20 days after completion of the repairs or alterations; or if the aircraft will be registered in a foreign jurisdiction and:(I) Application for the aircraft’s registration is properly filed with a civil airworthiness authority of a foreign jurisdiction within 10 days after the date of purchase;(II) The nonresident purchaser removes the aircraft from this state to a foreign jurisdiction within 10 days after the date the aircraft is registered by the applicable foreign airworthiness authority; and(III) The aircraft is operated in this state solely to remove it from this state to a foreign jurisdiction.For purposes of this sub-subparagraph, the term “foreign jurisdiction” means any jurisdiction outside of the United States or any of its territories;b. The nonresident purchaser, within 90 days after the date of departure, provides the department with written proof that the nonresident purchaser licensed, registered, titled, or documented the boat or aircraft outside this state. If such written proof is unavailable, within 90 days the nonresident purchaser must provide proof that the nonresident purchaser applied for such license, title, registration, or documentation. The nonresident purchaser shall forward to the department proof of title, license, registration, or documentation upon receipt;c. The nonresident purchaser, within 30 days after removing the boat or aircraft from this state, furnishes the department with proof of removal in the form of receipts for fuel, dockage, slippage, tie-down, or hangaring from outside of Florida. The information so provided must clearly and specifically identify the boat or aircraft;d. The selling dealer, within 30 days after the date of sale, provides to the department a copy of the sales invoice, closing statement, bills of sale, and the original affidavit signed by the nonresident purchaser affirming that the nonresident purchaser qualifies for exemption from sales tax pursuant to this subparagraph and attesting that the nonresident purchaser will provide the documentation required to substantiate the exemption claimed under this subparagraph;e. The seller makes a copy of the affidavit a part of his or her record for as long as required by s. 213.35; andf. Unless the nonresident purchaser of a boat of 5 net tons of admeasurement or larger intends to remove the boat from this state within 10 days after the date of purchase or when the boat is repaired or altered, within 20 days after completion of the repairs or alterations, the nonresident purchaser applies to the selling dealer for a decal which authorizes 90 days after the date of purchase for removal of the boat. The nonresident purchaser of a qualifying boat may apply to the selling dealer within 60 days after the date of purchase for an extension decal that authorizes the boat to remain in this state for an additional 90 days, but not more than a total of 180 days, before the nonresident purchaser is required to pay the tax imposed by this chapter. The department is authorized to issue decals in advance to dealers. The number of decals issued in advance to a dealer shall be consistent with the volume of the dealer’s past sales of boats which qualify under this sub-subparagraph. The selling dealer or his or her agent shall mark and affix the decals to qualifying boats in the manner prescribed by the department, before delivery of the boat.(I) The department is hereby authorized to charge dealers a fee sufficient to recover the costs of decals issued, except the extension decal shall cost $425.(II) The proceeds from the sale of decals will be deposited into the administrative trust fund.(III) Decals shall display information to identify the boat as a qualifying boat under this sub-subparagraph, including, but not limited to, the decal’s date of expiration.(IV) The department is authorized to require dealers who purchase decals to file reports with the department and may prescribe all necessary records by rule. All such records are subject to inspection by the department.(V) Any dealer or his or her agent who issues a decal falsely, fails to affix a decal, mismarks the expiration date of a decal, or fails to properly account for decals will be considered prima facie to have committed a fraudulent act to evade the tax and will be liable for payment of the tax plus a mandatory penalty of 200 percent of the tax, and shall be liable for fine and punishment as provided by law for a conviction of a misdemeanor of the first degree, as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.(VI) Any nonresident purchaser of a boat who removes a decal before permanently removing the boat from this state, or defaces, changes, modifies, or alters a decal in a manner affecting its expiration date before its expiration, or who causes or allows the same to be done by another, will be considered prima facie to have committed a fraudulent act to evade the tax and will be liable for payment of the tax plus a mandatory penalty of 200 percent of the tax, and shall be liable for fine and punishment as provided by law for a conviction of a misdemeanor of the first degree, as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.(VII) The department is authorized to adopt rules necessary to administer and enforce this subparagraph and to publish the necessary forms and instructions.(VIII) The department is hereby authorized to adopt emergency rules pursuant to s. 120.54(4) to administer and enforce the provisions of this subparagraph.If the nonresident purchaser fails to remove the qualifying boat from this state within the maximum 180 days after purchase or a nonqualifying boat or an aircraft from this state within 10 days after purchase or, when the boat or aircraft is repaired or altered, within 20 days after completion of such repairs or alterations, or permits the boat or aircraft to return to this state within 6 months after the date of departure, except as provided in s. 212.08(7)(fff), or if the nonresident purchaser fails to furnish the department with any of the documentation required by this subparagraph within the prescribed time period, the nonresident purchaser is liable for use tax on the cost price of the boat or aircraft and, in addition thereto, payment of a penalty to the Department of Revenue equal to the tax payable. This penalty is in lieu of the penalty imposed by s. 212.12(2). The maximum 180-day period following the sale of a qualifying boat tax-exempt to a nonresident may not be tolled for any reason.

(b) At the rate of 6 percent of the cost price of each item or article of tangible personal property when the same is not sold but is used, consumed, distributed, or stored for use or consumption in this state; however, for tangible property originally purchased exempt from tax for use exclusively for lease and which is converted to the owner’s own use, tax may be paid on the fair market value of the property at the time of conversion. If the fair market value of the property cannot be determined, use tax at the time of conversion shall be based on the owner’s acquisition cost. Under no circumstances may the aggregate amount of sales tax from leasing the property and use tax due at the time of conversion be less than the total sales tax that would have been due on the original acquisition cost paid by the owner.

1(c) At the rate of 6 percent of the gross proceeds derived from the lease or rental of tangible personal property, as defined herein; however, the following special provisions apply to the lease or rental of motor vehicles and to peer-to-peer car-sharing programs:1. When a motor vehicle is leased or rented by a motor vehicle rental company or through a peer-to-peer car-sharing program as those terms are defined in s. 212.0606(1) for a period of less than 12 months:a. If the motor vehicle is rented in Florida, the entire amount of such rental is taxable, even if the vehicle is dropped off in another state.b. If the motor vehicle is rented in another state and dropped off in Florida, the rental is exempt from Florida tax.c. If the motor vehicle is rented through a peer-to-peer car-sharing program, the peer-to-peer car-sharing program shall collect and remit the applicable tax due in connection with the rental.2. Except as provided in subparagraph 3., for the lease or rental of a motor vehicle for a period of not less than 12 months, sales tax is due on the lease or rental payments if the vehicle is registered in this state; provided, however, that no tax shall be due if the taxpayer documents use of the motor vehicle outside this state and tax is being paid on the lease or rental payments in another state.3. The tax imposed by this chapter does not apply to the lease or rental of a commercial motor vehicle as defined in s. 316.003(14)(a) to one lessee or rentee, or of a motor vehicle as defined in s. 316.003 which is to be used primarily in the trade or established business of the lessee or rentee, for a period of not less than 12 months when tax was paid on the purchase price of such vehicle by the lessor. To the extent tax was paid with respect to the purchase of such vehicle in another state, territory of the United States, or the District of Columbia, the Florida tax payable shall be reduced in accordance with s. 212.06(7). This subparagraph shall only be available when the lease or rental of such property is an established business or part of an established business or the same is incidental or germane to such business.

(d) At the rate of 6 percent of the lease or rental price paid by a lessee or rentee, or contracted or agreed to be paid by a lessee or rentee, to the owner of the tangible personal property.

2(e)1. At the rate of 6 percent on charges for:a. Prepaid calling arrangements. The tax on charges for prepaid calling arrangements shall be collected at the time of sale and remitted by the selling dealer.(I) “Prepaid calling arrangement” has the same meaning as provided in s. 202.11.(II) If the sale or recharge of the prepaid calling arrangement does not take place at the dealer’s place of business, it shall be deemed to have taken place at the customer’s shipping address or, if no item is shipped, at the customer’s address or the location associated with the customer’s mobile telephone number.(III) The sale or recharge of a prepaid calling arrangement shall be treated as a sale of tangible personal property for purposes of this chapter, regardless of whether a tangible item evidencing such arrangement is furnished to the purchaser, and such sale within this state subjects the selling dealer to the jurisdiction of this state for purposes of this subsection.(IV) No additional tax under this chapter or chapter 202 is due or payable if a purchaser of a prepaid calling arrangement who has paid tax under this chapter on the sale or recharge of such arrangement applies one or more units of the prepaid calling arrangement to obtain communications services as described in s. 202.11(9)(b)3., other services that are not communications services, or products.b. The installation of telecommunication and telegraphic equipment.c. Electrical power or energy, except that the tax rate for charges for electrical power or energy is 4.35 percent. Charges for electrical power and energy do not include taxes imposed under ss. 166.231 and 203.01(1)(a)3.2. Section 212.17(3), regarding credit for tax paid on charges subsequently found to be worthless, is equally applicable to any tax paid under this section on charges for prepaid calling arrangements, telecommunication or telegraph services, or electric power subsequently found to be uncollectible. As used in this paragraph, the term “charges” does not include any excise or similar tax levied by the Federal Government, a political subdivision of this state, or a municipality upon the purchase, sale, or recharge of prepaid calling arrangements or upon the purchase or sale of telecommunication, television system program, or telegraph service or electric power, which tax is collected by the seller from the purchaser.

(f) At the rate of 6 percent on the sale, rental, use, consumption, or storage for use in this state of machines and equipment, and parts and accessories therefor, used in manufacturing, processing, compounding, producing, mining, or quarrying personal property for sale or to be used in furnishing communications, transportation, or public utility services.

(g)1. At the rate of 6 percent on the retail price of newspapers and magazines sold or used in Florida.2. Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, inserts of printed materials which are distributed with a newspaper or magazine are a component part of the newspaper or magazine, and neither the sale nor use of such inserts is subject to tax when:a. Printed by a newspaper or magazine publisher or commercial printer and distributed as a component part of a newspaper or magazine, which means that the items after being printed are delivered directly to a newspaper or magazine publisher by the printer for inclusion in editions of the distributed newspaper or magazine;b. Such publications are labeled as part of the designated newspaper or magazine publication into which they are to be inserted; andc. The purchaser of the insert presents a resale certificate to the vendor stating that the inserts are to be distributed as a component part of a newspaper or magazine.

(h)1. A tax is imposed at the rate of 4 percent on the charges for the use of coin-operated amusement machines. The tax shall be calculated by dividing the gross receipts from such charges for the applicable reporting period by a divisor, determined as provided in this subparagraph, to compute gross taxable sales, and then subtracting gross taxable sales from gross receipts to arrive at the amount of tax due. For counties that do not impose a discretionary sales surtax, the divisor is equal to 1.04; for counties that impose a 0.5 percent discretionary sales surtax, the divisor is equal to 1.045; for counties that impose a 1 percent discretionary sales surtax, the divisor is equal to 1.050; and for counties that impose a 2 percent sales surtax, the divisor is equal to 1.060. If a county imposes a discretionary sales surtax that is not listed in this subparagraph, the department shall make the applicable divisor available in an electronic format or otherwise. Additional divisors shall bear the same mathematical relationship to the next higher and next lower divisors as the new surtax rate bears to the next higher and next lower surtax rates for which divisors have been established. When a machine is activated by a slug, token, coupon, or any similar device which has been purchased, the tax is on the price paid by the user of the device for such device.2. As used in this paragraph, the term “operator” means any person who possesses a coin-operated amusement machine for the purpose of generating sales through that machine and who is responsible for removing the receipts from the machine.a. If the owner of the machine is also the operator of it, he or she shall be liable for payment of the tax without any deduction for rent or a license fee paid to a location owner for the use of any real property on which the machine is located.b. If the owner or lessee of the machine is also its operator, he or she shall be liable for payment of the tax on the purchase or lease of the machine, as well as the tax on sales generated through the machine.c. If the proprietor of the business where the machine is located does not own the machine, he or she shall be deemed to be the lessee and operator of the machine and is responsible for the payment of the tax on sales, unless such responsibility is otherwise provided for in a written agreement between him or her and the machine owner.3.a. An operator of a coin-operated amusement machine may not operate or cause to be operated in this state any such machine until the operator has registered with the department and has conspicuously displayed an identifying certificate issued by the department. The identifying certificate shall be issued by the department upon application from the operator. The identifying certificate shall include a unique number, and the certificate shall be permanently marked with the operator’s name, the operator’s sales tax number, and the maximum number of machines to be operated under the certificate. An identifying certificate shall not be transferred from one operator to another. The identifying certificate must be conspicuously displayed on the premises where the coin-operated amusement machines are being operated.b. The operator of the machine must obtain an identifying certificate before the machine is first operated in the state and by July 1 of each year thereafter. The annual fee for each certificate shall be based on the number of machines identified on the application times $30 and is due and payable upon application for the identifying device. The application shall contain the operator’s name, sales tax number, business address where the machines are being operated, and the number of machines in operation at that place of business by the operator. No operator may operate more machines than are listed on the certificate. A new certificate is required if more machines are being operated at that location than are listed on the certificate. The fee for the new certificate shall be based on the number of additional machines identified on the application form times $30.c. A penalty of $250 per machine is imposed on the operator for failing to properly obtain and display the required identifying certificate. A penalty of $250 is imposed on the lessee of any machine placed in a place of business without a proper current identifying certificate. Such penalties shall apply in addition to all other applicable taxes, interest, and penalties.d. Operators of coin-operated amusement machines must obtain a separate sales and use tax certificate of registration for each county in which such machines are located. One sales and use tax certificate of registration is sufficient for all of the operator’s machines within a single county.4. The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to coin-operated amusement machines owned and operated by churches or synagogues.5. In addition to any other penalties imposed by this chapter, a person who knowingly and willfully violates any provision of this paragraph commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.6. The department may adopt rules necessary to administer the provisions of this paragraph.

(i)1. At the rate of 6 percent on charges for all:a. Detective, burglar protection, and other protection services (NAICS National Numbers 561611, 561612, 561613, and 561621). Fingerprint services required under s. 790.06 or s. 790.062 are not subject to the tax. Any law enforcement officer, as defined in s. 943.10, who is performing approved duties as determined by his or her local law enforcement agency in his or her capacity as a law enforcement officer, and who is subject to the direct and immediate command of his or her law enforcement agency, and in the law enforcement officer’s uniform as authorized by his or her law enforcement agency, is performing law enforcement and public safety services and is not performing detective, burglar protection, or other protective services, if the law enforcement officer is performing his or her approved duties in a geographical area in which the law enforcement officer has arrest jurisdiction. Such law enforcement and public safety services are not subject to tax irrespective of whether the duty is characterized as “extra duty,” “off-duty,” or “secondary employment,” and irrespective of whether the officer is paid directly or through the officer’s agency by an outside source. The term “law enforcement officer” includes full-time or part-time law enforcement officers, and any auxiliary law enforcement officer, when such auxiliary law enforcement officer is working under the direct supervision of a full-time or part-time law enforcement officer.b. Nonresidential cleaning, excluding cleaning of the interiors of transportation equipment, and nonresidential building pest control services (NAICS National Numbers 561710 and 561720).2. As used in this paragraph, “NAICS” means those classifications contained in the North American Industry Classification System, as published in 2007 by the Office of Management and Budget, Executive Office of the President.3. Charges for detective, burglar protection, and other protection security services performed in this state but used outside this state are exempt from taxation. Charges for detective, burglar protection, and other protection security services performed outside this state and used in this state are subject to tax.4. If a transaction involves both the sale or use of a service taxable under this paragraph and the sale or use of a service or any other item not taxable under this chapter, the consideration paid must be separately identified and stated with respect to the taxable and exempt portions of the transaction or the entire transaction shall be presumed taxable. The burden shall be on the seller of the service or the purchaser of the service, whichever applicable, to overcome this presumption by providing documentary evidence as to which portion of the transaction is exempt from tax. The department is authorized to adjust the amount of consideration identified as the taxable and exempt portions of the transaction; however, a determination that the taxable and exempt portions are inaccurately stated and that the adjustment is applicable must be supported by substantial competent evidence.5. Each seller of services subject to sales tax pursuant to this paragraph shall maintain a monthly log showing each transaction for which sales tax was not collected because the services meet the requirements of subparagraph 3. for out-of-state use. The log must identify the purchaser’s name, location and mailing address, and federal employer identification number, if a business, or the social security number, if an individual, the service sold, the price of the service, the date of sale, the reason for the exemption, and the sales invoice number. The monthly log shall be maintained pursuant to the same requirements and subject to the same penalties imposed for the keeping of similar records pursuant to this chapter.

(j)1. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, there is hereby levied a tax on the sale, use, consumption, or storage for use in this state of any coin or currency, whether in circulation or not, when such coin or currency:a. Is not legal tender;b. If legal tender, is sold, exchanged, or traded at a rate in excess of its face value; orc. Is sold, exchanged, or traded at a rate based on its precious metal content.2. Such tax shall be at a rate of 6 percent of the price at which the coin or currency is sold, exchanged, or traded, except that, with respect to a coin or currency which is legal tender of the United States and which is sold, exchanged, or traded, such tax shall not be levied.3. There are exempt from this tax exchanges of coins or currency which are in general circulation in, and legal tender of, one nation for coins or currency which are in general circulation in, and legal tender of, another nation when exchanged solely for use as legal tender and at an exchange rate based on the relative value of each as a medium of exchange.4. With respect to any transaction that involves the sale of coins or currency taxable under this paragraph in which the taxable amount represented by the sale of such coins or currency exceeds $500, the entire amount represented by the sale of such coins or currency is exempt from the tax imposed under this paragraph. The dealer must maintain proper documentation, as prescribed by rule of the department, to identify that portion of a transaction which involves the sale of coins or currency and is exempt under this subparagraph.

(k) At the rate of 6 percent of the sales price of each gallon of diesel fuel not taxed under chapter 206 purchased for use in a vessel, except dyed diesel fuel that is exempt pursuant to s. 212.08(4)(a)4.

(l) Florists located in this state are liable for sales tax on sales to retail customers regardless of where or by whom the items sold are to be delivered. Florists located in this state are not liable for sales tax on payments received from other florists for items delivered to customers in this state.

(m) Operators of game concessions or other concessionaires who customarily award tangible personal property as prizes may, in lieu of paying tax on the cost price of such property, pay tax on 25 percent of the gross receipts from such concession activity.

(n) At the rate of 3 percent of the sales price on the retail sale of a new mobile home. As used in this paragraph, the term “new mobile home” has the same meaning as in s. 319.001.

From the funds specified in subparagraphs (d)1. and 2. for indigent health care services, service providers shall receive reimbursement at a Medicaid rate to be determined by the governing board, agency, or authority created pursuant to this paragraph for the initial emergency room visit, and a per-member per-month fee or capitation for those members enrolled in their service area, as compensation for the services rendered following the initial emergency visit. Except for provisions of emergency services, upon determination of eligibility, enrollment shall be deemed to have occurred at the time services were rendered. The provisions for specific reimbursement of emergency services shall be repealed on July 1, 2001, unless otherwise reenacted by the Legislature. The capitation amount or rate shall be determined before program implementation by an independent actuarial consultant. In no event shall such reimbursement rates exceed the Medicaid rate. The plan must also provide that any hospitals owned and operated by government entities on or after the effective date of this act must, as a condition of receiving funds under this subsection, afford public access equal to that provided under s. 286.011 as to any meeting of the governing board, agency, or authority the subject of which is budgeting resources for the retention of charity care, as that term is defined in the rules of the Agency for Health Care Administration. The plan shall also include innovative health care programs that provide cost-effective alternatives to traditional methods of service and delivery funding.3. The plan’s benefits shall be made available to all county residents currently eligible to receive health care services as indigents or medically poor as defined in paragraph (4)(d).4. Eligible residents who participate in the health care plan shall receive coverage for a period of 12 months or the period extending from the time of enrollment to the end of the current fiscal year, per enrollment period, whichever is less.5. At the end of each fiscal year, the governing board, agency, or authority shall prepare an audit that reviews the budget of the plan, delivery of services, and quality of services, and makes recommendations to increase the plan’s efficiency. The audit shall take into account participant hospital satisfaction with the plan and assess the amount of poststabilization patient transfers requested, and accepted or denied, by the county public general hospital.

(a) The school board in each county may levy, pursuant to resolution conditioned to take effect only upon approval by a majority vote of the electors of the county voting in a referendum, a discretionary sales surtax at a rate that may not exceed 0.5 percent.

(b) The resolution must include a statement that provides a brief and general description of the school capital outlay projects to be funded by the surtax. The resolution must include a statement that the revenues collected must be shared with eligible charter schools based on their proportionate share of the total school district enrollment. The statement must conform to the requirements of s. 101.161 and shall be placed on the ballot by the governing body of the county. The following question shall be placed on the ballot: FOR THE CENTS TAX AGAINST THE CENTS TAX

(c) The resolution providing for the imposition of the surtax must set forth a plan for use of the surtax proceeds for fixed capital expenditures or fixed capital costs associated with the construction, reconstruction, or improvement of school facilities and campuses which have a useful life expectancy of 5 or more years, and any land acquisition, land improvement, design, and engineering costs related thereto, or any purchase, lease-purchase, lease, or maintenance of school buses, as defined in s. 1006.25, which have a life expectancy of 5 years or more. Additionally, the plan shall include the costs of retrofitting and providing for technology implementation, including hardware and software, for the various sites within the school district. Surtax revenues may be used to service bond indebtedness to finance projects authorized by this subsection, and any interest accrued thereto may be held in trust to finance such projects. Neither the proceeds of the surtax nor any interest accrued thereto shall be used for operational expenses. Surtax revenues shared with charter schools shall be shared based on their proportionate share of total school district capital outlay full-time equivalent enrollment as adopted by the education estimating conference established in s. 216.136 and expended by the charter school in a manner consistent with the allowable uses set forth in s. 1013.62(4). All revenues and expenditures shall be accounted for in a charter school’s monthly or quarterly financial statement pursuant to s. 1002.33(9). The eligibility of a charter school to receive funds under this subsection shall be determined in accordance with s. 1013.62(1). If a school’s charter is not renewed or is terminated and the school is dissolved under the provisions of law under which the school was organized, any unencumbered funds received under this subsection shall revert to the sponsor.

(d) Surtax revenues collected by the Department of Revenue pursuant to this subsection shall be distributed to the school board imposing the surtax in accordance with law.

(a)1. The governing body in each county that has a population of fewer than 800,000 residents may levy an indigent care surtax pursuant to an ordinance conditioned to take effect only upon approval by a majority vote of the electors of the county voting in a referendum. The surtax may be levied at a rate not to exceed 0.5 percent, except that if a publicly supported medical school is located in the county, the rate shall not exceed 1 percent.2. Notwithstanding subparagraph 1., the governing body of any county that has a population of fewer than 50,000 residents may levy an indigent care surtax pursuant to an ordinance conditioned to take effect only upon approval by a majority vote of the electors of the county voting in a referendum. The surtax may be levied at a rate not to exceed 1 percent.

(b) A statement that includes a brief and general description of the purposes to be funded by the surtax and that conforms to the requirements of s. 101.161 shall be placed on the ballot by the governing body of the county. The following questions shall be placed on the ballot:FOR THE. . . .CENTS TAXAGAINST THE. . . .CENTS TAX

(c)1. The ordinance adopted by the governing body providing for the imposition of the surtax must set forth a plan for providing health care services to qualified residents, as defined in paragraph (d). The plan and subsequent amendments to it shall fund a broad range of health care services for indigent persons and the medically poor, including, but not limited to, primary care and preventive care, as well as hospital care. It shall emphasize a continuity of care in the most cost-effective setting, taking into consideration a high quality of care and geographic access. Where consistent with these objectives, it shall include, without limitation, services rendered by physicians, clinics, community hospitals, mental health centers, and alternative delivery sites, as well as at least one regional referral hospital where appropriate. It shall provide that agreements negotiated between the county and providers shall include reimbursement methodologies that take into account the cost of services rendered to eligible patients, recognize hospitals that render a disproportionate share of indigent care, provide other incentives to promote the delivery of charity care, and require cost containment, including, but not limited to, case management. The plan must also include innovative health care programs that provide cost-effective alternatives to traditional methods of service delivery and funding.2. In addition to the uses specified or services required to be provided under this subsection, the ordinance adopted by a county that has a population of fewer than 50,000 residents may pledge surtax proceeds to service new or existing bond indebtedness incurred to finance, plan, construct, or reconstruct a public or not-for-profit hospital in such county and any land acquisition, land improvement, design, or engineering costs related to such hospital, if the governing body of the county determines that a public or not-for-profit hospital existing at the time of issuance of the bonds authorized under this subparagraph would, more likely than not, otherwise cease to operate. The plan required under this paragraph may, by an extraordinary vote of the governing body of such county, provide that some or all of the surtax revenues and any interest earned must be expended for the purpose of servicing such bond indebtedness. Such county may also use the services of the Division of Bond Finance of the State Board of Administration pursuant to the State Bond Act to issue bonds under this subparagraph. A jurisdiction may not issue bonds under this subparagraph more frequently than once per year. Any county that has a population of fewer than 50,000 residents at the time any bonds authorized in this subparagraph are issued retains the authority granted under this subparagraph throughout the terms of such bonds, including the term of any refinancing bonds, regardless of any subsequent increase in population which would result in such county having 50,000 or more residents.

(d) For the purpose of this subsection, the term “qualified residents” means residents of the authorizing county who are:1. Qualified as indigent persons as certified by the authorizing county;2. Certified by the authorizing county as meeting the definition of the medically poor, defined as persons having insufficient income, resources, and assets to provide the needed medical care without using resources required to meet basic needs for shelter, food, clothing, and personal expenses; not being eligible for any other state or federal program or having medical needs that are not covered by any such program; or having insufficient third-party insurance coverage. In all cases, the authorizing county shall serve as the payor of last resort; or3. Participating in innovative, cost-effective programs approved by the authorizing county.

(e) Moneys collected pursuant to this subsection remain the property of the state and shall be distributed by the Department of Revenue on a regular and periodic basis to the clerk of the circuit court as ex officio custodian of the funds of the authorizing county. The clerk of the circuit court shall:1. Maintain the moneys in an indigent health care trust fund.2. Invest any funds held on deposit in the trust fund pursuant to general law.3. Disburse the funds, including any interest earned, to any provider of health care services, as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d), upon directive from the authorizing county.4. Disburse the funds, including any interest earned, to service any bond indebtedness authorized in this subsection upon directive from the authorizing county, which directive may be irrevocably given at the time the bond indebtedness is incurred.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a county may not levy local option sales surtaxes authorized in this subsection and subsections (2) and (3) in excess of a combined rate of 1 percent or, if a publicly supported medical school is located in the county or the county has a population of fewer than 50,000 residents, in excess of a combined rate of 1.5 percent.

(a) The governing authority of a county, other than a county that has imposed two separate discretionary surtaxes without expiration, may, by ordinance, levy a discretionary sales surtax of up to 1 percent for emergency fire rescue services and facilities as provided in this subsection. As used in this subsection, the term “emergency fire rescue services” includes, but is not limited to, preventing and extinguishing fires; protecting and saving life and property from fires or natural or intentional acts or disasters; enforcing municipal, county, or state fire prevention codes and laws pertaining to the prevention and control of fires; and providing prehospital emergency medical treatment.

(b) Upon the adoption of the ordinance, the levy of the surtax must be placed on the ballot by the governing authority of the county enacting the ordinance. The ordinance will take effect if approved by a majority of the electors of the county voting in a referendum held for such purpose. The referendum shall be placed on the ballot of a general election. The ballot for the referendum must conform to the requirements of s. 101.161.

(c) Pursuant to s. 212.054(4), the proceeds of the discretionary sales surtax collected under this subsection, less an administrative fee that may be retained by the Department of Revenue, shall be distributed by the department to the county. The county shall distribute the proceeds it receives from the department to each local government entity providing emergency fire rescue services in the county. The surtax proceeds, less an administrative fee not to exceed 2 percent of the surtax collected, shall be distributed by the county based on each entity’s average annual expenditures for fire control and emergency fire rescue services in the 5 fiscal years preceding the fiscal year in which the surtax takes effect in proportion to the average annual total of the expenditures for such entities in the 5 fiscal years preceding the fiscal year in which the surtax takes effect. The county shall revise the distribution proportions to reflect a change in the service area of an entity receiving a distribution of the surtax proceeds. If an entity declines its share of surtax revenue, such revenue shall be redistributed proportionally to the entities that are participating in the sharing of such revenue based on each participating entity’s average annual expenditures for fire control and emergency fire rescue services in the preceding 5 fiscal years in proportion to the average annual total of the expenditures for the participating entities in the preceding 5 fiscal years.

(d) If a local government entity requests personnel or equipment from any other service provider on a long-term basis and the personnel or equipment is provided, the local government entity providing the service is entitled to payment from the requesting service provider from that provider’s share of the surtax proceeds for all costs of the equipment or personnel.

(e) Upon the surtax taking effect and initiation of collections, each local government entity receiving a share of surtax proceeds shall reduce the ad valorem tax levy or any non-ad valorem assessment for fire control and emergency rescue services in its next and subsequent budgets by the estimated amount of revenue provided by the surtax.

(f) Use of surtax proceeds authorized under this subsection does not relieve a local government entity from complying with chapter 200 and any related provision of law that establishes millage caps or limits undesignated budget reserves and procedures for establishing rollback rates for ad valorem taxes and budget adoption. If surtax collections exceed projected collections in any fiscal year, any surplus distribution shall be used to further reduce ad valorem taxes in the next fiscal year. These proceeds shall be applied as a rebate to the final millage, after the TRIM notice is completed in accordance with this provision. If a local government entity receiving a share of the surtax is unable to further reduce ad valorem taxes because the millage rate is zero, the funds shall be applied to reduce any non-ad valorem assessments levied for the purposes described in this section. If no ad valorem or non-ad valorem reduction is possible, the surplus surtax collections shall be returned to the county, and the county shall reduce the county millage rates to offset the surplus surtax proceeds.

(g) Surtax collections shall be initiated on January 1 of the year following a successful referendum in order to coincide with s. 212.054(5).

(h) Notwithstanding s. 212.054, if a multicounty independent special district created pursuant to chapter 67-764, Laws of Florida, levies ad valorem taxes on district property to fund emergency fire rescue services within the district and is required by s. 2, Art. VII of the State Constitution to maintain a uniform ad valorem tax rate throughout the district, the county may not levy the discretionary sales surtax authorized by this subsection within the boundaries of the district.

(a) The governing body of a county may levy a pension liability surtax to fund an underfunded defined benefit retirement plan or system, pursuant to an ordinance conditioned to take effect upon approval by a majority vote of the electors of the county voting in a referendum, at a rate that may not exceed 0.5 percent. The county may not impose a pension liability surtax unless the underfunded defined benefit retirement plan or system is below 80 percent of actuarial funding at the time the ordinance or referendum is passed. The most recent actuarial report submitted to the Department of Management Services pursuant to s. 112.63 must be used to establish the level of actuarial funding for purposes of determining eligibility to impose the surtax. The governing body of a county may only impose the surtax if:1. An employee, including a police officer or firefighter, who enters employment on or after the date when the local government certifies that the defined benefit retirement plan or system formerly available to such an employee has been closed may not enroll in a defined benefit retirement plan or system that will receive surtax proceeds.2. The local government and the collective bargaining representative for the members of the underfunded defined benefit retirement plan or system or, if there is no representative, a majority of the members of the plan or system, mutually consent to requiring each member to make an employee retirement contribution of at least 10 percent of each member’s salary for each pay period beginning with the first pay period after the plan or system is closed.3. The pension board of trustees for the underfunded defined benefit retirement plan or system, if such board exists, is prohibited from participating in the collective bargaining process and engaging in the determination of pension benefits.4. The county currently levies a local government infrastructure surtax pursuant to subsection (2) which is scheduled to terminate and is not subject to renewal.5. The pension liability surtax does not take effect until the local government infrastructure surtax described in subparagraph 4. is terminated.

(b) A referendum to adopt a pension liability surtax must meet the requirements of s. 101.161 and must include a brief and general description of the purposes for which the surtax proceeds will be used.

(c) Pursuant to s. 212.054(4), the proceeds of the surtax collected under this subsection, less an administrative fee that may be retained by the department, shall be distributed by the department to the local government.

(d) The local government may use the pension liability surtax proceeds in the following manner:1. If the proceeds of the pension liability surtax have been actuarially recognized as provided in s. 112.64(6), the local government must distribute the proceeds to an eligible defined benefit retirement plan or system, not including the Florida Retirement System.2. If the proceeds of the pension liability surtax have not been actuarially recognized, the local government is authorized to distribute the proceeds to an eligible defined benefit retirement plan or system, not including the Florida Retirement System, to pledge the proceeds of the surtax to repay debts incurred for the purpose of making advanced payments toward the unfunded liability of an underfunded defined benefit retirement plan or system, and to reimburse itself from the proceeds of the surtax for any borrowing costs associated with such debts.

(e) The ordinance providing for the imposition of the pension liability surtax must specify how the proceeds will be used:1. The ordinance must specify the method of determining the percentage of the proceeds, and the frequency of such payments, distributed to each eligible defined benefit retirement plan or system if the proceeds of the pension liability surtax are actuarially recognized as provided in s. 112.64(6).2. The ordinance must specify the local government’s intention to incur debt for the purpose of making advanced payments toward the unfunded liability of an underfunded defined benefit retirement plan or system if the proceeds of the pension liability surtax are not actuarially recognized as provided in s. 112.64(6).

(f) A pension liability surtax imposed pursuant to this subsection shall terminate on December 31 of the year in which the actuarial funding level is expected to reach or exceed 100 percent for the defined benefit retirement plan or system for which the surtax was levied or December 31, 2060, whichever occurs first. The most recent actuarial report submitted to the Department of Management Services pursuant to s. 112.63 must be used to establish the level of actuarial funding.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a county may not levy local option sales surtaxes authorized in this subsection and subsections (2), (3), (4), and (5) in excess of a combined rate of 1 percent.

(a) To adopt a discretionary sales surtax under this section, an independent certified public accountant licensed pursuant to chapter 473 shall conduct a performance audit of the program associated with the proposed surtax.

(b)1. At least 180 days before the referendum is held, the county or school district shall provide a copy of the final resolution or ordinance to the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability.2. Within 60 days after receiving the final resolution or ordinance, the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability shall procure the certified public accountant and may use carryforward funds to pay for the services of the certified public accountant.3. At least 60 days before the referendum is held, the performance audit must be completed and the audit report, including any findings, recommendations, or other accompanying documents, must be made available on the official website of the county or school district.4. The county or school district shall keep the information on its website for 2 years from the date it was posted.5. The failure to comply with the requirements under subparagraph 1. or subparagraph 3. renders any referendum held to adopt a discretionary sales surtax void.

(c) For purposes of this subsection, the term “performance audit” means an examination of the program conducted according to applicable government auditing standards or auditing and evaluation standards of other appropriate authoritative bodies. At a minimum, a performance audit must include an examination of issues related to the following:1. The economy, efficiency, or effectiveness of the program.2. The structure or design of the program to accomplish its goals and objectives.3. Alternative methods of providing program services or products.4. Goals, objectives, and performance measures used by the program to monitor and report program accomplishments.5. The accuracy or adequacy of public documents, reports, and requests prepared by the county or school district which relate to the program.6. Compliance of the program with appropriate policies, rules, and laws.

(d) This subsection does not apply to a referendum held to adopt the same discretionary surtax that was in place during the month of December immediately before the date of the referendum.

"(1)(a) The aforesaid tax at the rate of 6 percent of the retail sales price as of the moment of sale, 6 percent of the cost price as of the moment of purchase, or 6 percent of the cost price as of the moment of commingling with the general mass of property in this state, as the case may be, shall be collectible from all dealers as herein defined on the sale at retail, the use, the consumption, the distribution, and the storage for use or consumption in this state of tangible personal property or services taxable under this chapter. The full amount of the tax on a credit sale, installment sale, or sale made on any kind of deferred payment plan shall be due at the moment of the transaction in the same manner as on a cash sale.

(b) Except as otherwise provided, any person who manufactures, produces, compounds, processes, or fabricates in any manner tangible personal property for his or her own use shall pay a tax upon the cost of the product manufactured, produced, compounded, processed, or fabricated without any deduction therefrom on account of the cost of material used, labor or service costs, or transportation charges, notwithstanding the provisions of s. 212.02 defining “cost price.” However, the tax levied under this paragraph shall not be imposed upon any person who manufactures or produces electrical power or energy, steam energy, or other energy at a single location, when such power or energy is used directly and exclusively at such location, or at other locations if the energy is transferred through facilities of the owner in the operation of machinery or equipment that is used to manufacture, process, compound, produce, fabricate, or prepare for shipment tangible personal property for sale or to operate pollution control equipment, maintenance equipment, or monitoring or control equipment used in such operations. The manufacture or production of electrical power or energy that is used for space heating, lighting, office equipment, or air-conditioning or any other, nonprocessing, noncompounding, nonproducing, nonfabricating, or nonshipping activity is taxable. Electrical power or energy consumed or dissipated in the transmission or distribution of electrical power or energy for resale is also not taxable. Fabrication labor shall not be taxable when a person is using his or her own equipment and personnel, for his or her own account, as a producer, subproducer, or coproducer of a qualified motion picture. For purposes of this chapter, the term “qualified motion picture” means all or any part of a series of related images, either on film, tape, or other embodiment, including, but not limited to, all items comprising part of the original work and film-related products derived therefrom as well as duplicates and prints thereof and all sound recordings created to accompany a motion picture, which is produced, adapted, or altered for exploitation in, on, or through any medium or device and at any location, primarily for entertainment, commercial, industrial, or educational purposes. This exemption for fabrication labor associated with production of a qualified motion picture will inure to the taxpayer upon presentation of the certificate of exemption issued to the taxpayer under the provisions of s. 288.1258. A person who manufactures factory-built buildings for his or her own use in the performance of contracts for the construction or improvement of real property shall pay a tax only upon the person’s cost price of items used in the manufacture of such buildings.

(c)1. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b), the use tax on asphalt manufactured for one’s own use shall be calculated with respect to paragraph (b) only upon the cost of materials which become a component part or which are an ingredient of the finished asphalt and upon the cost of the transportation of such components and ingredients. In addition, an indexed tax of 38 cents per ton of such manufactured asphalt shall be due at the same time and in the same manner as taxes due pursuant to paragraph (b). The indexed tax shall be adjusted each July 1 to an amount, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the product of 38 cents multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the annual average of the “materials and components for construction” series of the producer price index, as calculated and published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Statistics, for the previous calendar year, and the denominator of which is the annual average of said series for calendar year 1988.2. Manufactured asphalt used for any federal, state, or local government public works project shall be exempt from the indexed tax imposed by this paragraph.

(d) For purposes of paragraph (b), the department may establish a cost price amount for industry groups that manufacture, produce, compound, process, or fabricate tangible personal property for their own use in the performance of contracts for improvements to real property. Such cost price amount must be established as a percentage, rounded to the nearest whole number, of the total contract price charged for the improvement. The cost price percentages established must be adopted by rule pursuant to the procedures provided in s. 120.54, upon petition of a majority of the members of an industry group or by a statewide association that represents such industry group, and must be based on a reasonable estimate of average costs incurred by members of the petitioning industry group. The department is required to adopt a cost price percentage only if sufficient information is available to determine such percentage. The information considered by the department to establish the cost price percentage must be that set forth in the petition or that which is otherwise made available to the department. Any cost price percentage so established must be available only by election of a member of the industry group for which the percentage was established and may apply only to such periods or contracts for which the election is made. The election must be made by the taxpayer by timely accruing and remitting tax on the contract using the established percentage figure. If the taxpayer does not timely accrue and remit the use tax due for a contract using the percentage figure, the taxpayer may not later use this method of calculating the use tax due for that contract. Taxpayers must maintain adequate records showing the accrual of tax using the percentage figure on total contract price. Any cost price so established must remain available for use for a period of at least 5 years from the date of its adoption and must be reviewed and be subject to adjustment by the department no more frequently than at 5-year intervals. The provisions of this paragraph are not available to persons subject to paragraph (c).

(e)1. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, tax shall not be imposed on any vessel registered under s. 328.52 by a vessel dealer or vessel manufacturer with respect to a vessel used solely for demonstration, sales promotional, or testing purposes. The term “promotional purposes” shall include, but not be limited to, participation in fishing tournaments. For the purposes of this paragraph, “promotional purposes” means the entry of the vessel in a marine-related event where prospective purchasers would be in attendance, where the vessel is entered in the name of the dealer or manufacturer, and where the vessel is clearly marked as for sale, on which vessel the name of the dealer or manufacturer is clearly displayed, and which vessel has never been transferred into the dealer’s or manufacturer’s accounting books from an inventory item to a capital asset for depreciation purposes.2. The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to any vessel when used for transporting persons or goods for compensation; when offered, let, or rented to another for consideration; when offered for rent or hire as a means of transportation for compensation; or when offered or used to provide transportation for persons solicited through personal contact or through advertisement on a “share expense” basis.3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, tax may not be imposed on any vessel imported into this state for the sole purpose of being offered for sale at retail by a yacht broker or yacht dealer registered in this state if the vessel remains under the care, custody, and control of the registered broker or dealer and the owner of the vessel does not make personal use of the vessel during that time. The provisions of this chapter govern the taxability of any sale or use of the vessel subsequent to its importation under this provision.

(2)(a) The term “dealer,” as used in this chapter, includes every person who manufactures or produces tangible personal property for sale at retail; for use, consumption, or distribution; or for storage to be used or consumed in this state.

(b) The term “dealer” is further defined to mean every person, as used in this chapter, who imports, or causes to be imported, tangible personal property from any state or foreign country for sale at retail; for use, consumption, or distribution; or for storage to be used or consumed in this state.

(c) The term “dealer” is further defined to mean every person, as used in this chapter, who sells at retail or who offers for sale at retail, or who has in his or her possession for sale at retail; or for use, consumption, or distribution; or for storage to be used or consumed in this state, tangible personal property as defined herein, including a retailer who transacts a substantial number of remote sales or a marketplace provider that has a physical presence in this state or that makes or facilitates through its marketplace a substantial number of remote sales.

(d) The term “dealer” is further defined to mean any person who has sold at retail; or used, or consumed, or distributed; or stored for use or consumption in this state, tangible personal property and who cannot prove that the tax levied by this chapter has been paid on the sale at retail, the use, the consumption, the distribution, or the storage of such tangible personal property. However, the term “dealer” does not mean a person who is not a “dealer” under the definition of any other paragraph of this subsection and whose only owned or leased property (including property owned or leased by an affiliate) in this state is located at the premises of a printer with which it has contracted for printing, if such property consists of the final printed product, property which becomes a part of the final printed product, or property from which the printed product is produced.

(e) The term “dealer” is further defined to mean any person, as used in this chapter, who leases or rents tangible personal property, as defined in this chapter, for a consideration, permitting the use or possession of such property without transferring title thereto, except as expressly provided for to the contrary herein.

(f) The term “dealer” is further defined to mean any person, as used in this chapter, who maintains or has within this state, directly or by a subsidiary, an office, distributing house, salesroom, or house, warehouse, or other place of business.

(g) “Dealer” also means and includes every person who solicits business either by direct representatives, indirect representatives, or manufacturers’ agents; by distribution of catalogs or other advertising matter; or by any other means whatsoever, and by reason thereof receives orders for tangible personal property from consumers for use, consumption, distribution, and storage for use or consumption in the state; such dealer shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter from the purchaser, and no action, either in law or in equity, on a sale or transaction as provided by the terms of this chapter may be had in this state by any such dealer unless it is affirmatively shown that the provisions of this chapter have been fully complied with.

(h) “Dealer” also means and includes every person who, as a representative, agent, or solicitor of an out-of-state principal or principals, solicits, receives, and accepts orders from consumers in the state for future delivery and whose principal refuses to register as a dealer.

(i) “Dealer” also means and includes the state, county, municipality, any political subdivision, agency, bureau or department, or other state or local governmental instrumentality.

(j) The term “dealer” is further defined to mean any person who leases, or grants a license to use, occupy, or enter upon, living quarters, sleeping or housekeeping accommodations in hotels, apartment houses, roominghouses, tourist or trailer camps, real property, space or spaces in parking lots or garages for motor vehicles, docking or storage space or spaces for boats in boat docks or marinas, or tie-down or storage space or spaces for aircraft at airports. The term “dealer” also means any person who has leased, occupied, or used or was entitled to use any living quarters, sleeping or housekeeping accommodations in hotels, apartment houses, roominghouses, tourist or trailer camps, real property, space or spaces in parking lots or garages for motor vehicles or docking or storage space or spaces for boats in boat docks or marinas, or who has purchased communication services or electric power or energy, and who cannot prove that the tax levied by this chapter has been paid to the vendor or lessor on any such transactions. The term “dealer” does not include any person who leases, lets, rents, or grants a license to use, occupy, or enter upon any living quarters, sleeping quarters, or housekeeping accommodations in apartment houses, roominghouses, tourist camps, or trailer camps, and who exclusively enters into a bona fide written agreement for continuous residence for longer than 6 months in duration with any person who leases, lets, rents, or is granted a license to use such property.

(k) “Dealer” also means any person who sells, provides, or performs a service taxable under this chapter. “Dealer” also means any person who purchases, uses, or consumes a service taxable under this chapter who cannot prove that the tax levied by this chapter has been paid to the seller of the taxable service.

(m) The term “dealer” also means a forwarding agent as defined in subparagraph (5)(b)1. who has applied for and received a Florida Certificate of Forwarding Agent Address from the department.

(3)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), every dealer making sales, whether within or outside the state, of tangible personal property for distribution, storage, or use or other consumption, in this state, shall, at the time of making sales, collect the tax imposed by this chapter from the purchaser.

(b)1. A purchaser of printed materials shall have sole responsibility for the taxes imposed by this chapter on those materials when the printer of the materials delivers them to the United States Postal Service for mailing to persons other than the purchaser located within and outside this state. Printers of materials delivered by mail to persons other than the purchaser located within and outside this state shall have no obligation or responsibility for the payment or collection of any taxes imposed under this chapter on those materials. However, printers are obligated to collect the taxes imposed by this chapter on printed materials when all, or substantially all, of the materials will be mailed to persons located within this state. For purposes of the printer’s tax collection obligation, there is a rebuttable presumption that all materials printed at a facility are mailed to persons located within the same state as that in which the facility is located. A certificate provided by the purchaser to the printer concerning the delivery of the printed materials for that purchase or all purchases shall be sufficient for purposes of rebutting the presumption created herein.2. The Department of Revenue is authorized to adopt rules and forms to implement the provisions of this paragraph.

(5)(a)1. Except as provided in subparagraph 2., it is not the intention of this chapter to levy a tax upon tangible personal property imported, produced, or manufactured in this state for export, provided that tangible personal property may not be considered as being imported, produced, or manufactured for export unless the importer, producer, or manufacturer delivers the same to a forwarding agent for exporting or to a common carrier for shipment outside this state or mails the same by United States mail to a destination outside this state; or, in the case of aircraft being exported under their own power to a destination outside the continental limits of the United States, by submission to the department of a duly signed and validated United States customs declaration, showing the departure of the aircraft from the continental United States; and further with respect to aircraft, the canceled United States registry of said aircraft; or in the case of parts and equipment installed on aircraft of foreign registry, by submission to the department of documentation as provided by rule, showing the departure of the aircraft from the continental United States; nor is it the intention of this chapter to levy a tax on any sale that the state is prohibited from taxing under the Constitution or laws of the United States. Every retail sale made to a person physically present at the time of sale is presumed to have been delivered in this state.2.a. Notwithstanding subparagraph 1., a tax is levied on each sale of tangible personal property to be transported to a cooperating state as defined in sub-subparagraph c., at the rate specified in sub-subparagraph d. However, a Florida dealer is relieved from the requirements of collecting taxes pursuant to this subparagraph if the Florida dealer obtains from the purchaser an affidavit providing the purchaser’s name, address, state taxpayer identification number, and a statement that the purchaser is aware of his or her state’s use tax laws, is a registered dealer in Florida or another state, or is purchasing the tangible personal property for resale or is otherwise not required to pay the tax on the transaction. The department may, by rule, provide a form to be used for the purposes of this sub-subparagraph.b. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “cooperating state” means a state determined by the executive director of the department to cooperate satisfactorily with this state in collecting taxes on remote sales. To be determined a cooperating state, a state must meet all the following minimum requirements:(I) It levies and collects taxes on remote sales of property transported from that state to persons in this state, as described in s. 212.0596, upon request of the department.(II) The tax so collected is at the rate specified in s. 212.05, not including any local option or tourist or convention development taxes collected pursuant to s. 125.0104 or this chapter.(III) Such state agrees to remit to the department all taxes so collected no later than 30 days from the last day of the calendar quarter following their collection.(IV) Such state authorizes the department to audit dealers within its jurisdiction who make remote sales that are the subject of s. 212.0596, or makes arrangements deemed adequate by the department for auditing them with its own personnel.(V) Such state agrees to provide to the department records obtained by it from retailers or dealers in such state showing delivery of tangible personal property into this state upon which no sales or use tax has been paid in a manner similar to that provided in sub-subparagraph g.c. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “sales of tangible personal property to be transported to a cooperating state” means remote sales to a person who is in the cooperating state at the time the order is executed, from a dealer who receives that order in this state.d. The tax levied by sub-subparagraph a. shall be at the rate at which such a sale would have been taxed pursuant to the cooperating state’s tax laws if consummated in the cooperating state by a dealer and a purchaser, both of whom were physically present in that state at the time of the sale.e. The tax levied by sub-subparagraph a., when collected, shall be held in the State Treasury in trust for the benefit of the cooperating state and shall be paid to it at a time agreed upon between the department, acting for this state, and the cooperating state or the department or agency designated by it to act for it; however, such payment shall in no event be made later than 30 days from the last day of the calendar quarter after the tax was collected. Funds held in trust for the benefit of a cooperating state are not subject to the service charges imposed by s. 215.20.f. The department is authorized to perform such acts and to provide such cooperation to a cooperating state with reference to the tax levied by sub-subparagraph a. as is required of the cooperating state by sub-subparagraph b.g. In furtherance of this act, dealers selling tangible personal property for delivery in another state shall make available to the department, upon request of the department, records of all tangible personal property so sold. Such records must include a description of the property, the name and address of the purchaser, the name and address of the person to whom the property was sent, the purchase price of the property, information regarding whether sales tax was paid in this state on the purchase price, and such other information as the department may by rule prescribe.

This subparagraph does not prohibit the forwarding agent from collecting such tax from the consumer of the tangible personal property.8. A forwarding agent shall maintain the following records:a. Copies of sales invoices or receipts between the vendor and the consumer when provided by the vendor to the forwarding agent. If sales invoices or receipts are not provided to the forwarding agent, the forwarding agent must maintain export documentation evidencing the value of the purchase consistent with the federal Export Administration Regulations, 15 C.F.R. parts 730-774.b. Copies of federal returns evidencing the forwarding agent’s NAICS principal business activity code.c. Copies of invoices or other documentation evidencing shipment to the forwarding agent.d. Invoices between the forwarding agent and the consumer or other documentation evidencing the ship-to destination outside the United States.e. Invoices for foreign postal or transportation services.f. Bills of lading.g. Any other export documentation.Such records must be kept in an electronic format and made available for the department’s review pursuant to subparagraph 9. and ss. 212.13 and 213.35.9. Each certificate expires 5 years after the date of issuance, except as specified in this subparagraph.a. At least 30 days before expiration, a new application must be submitted to renew the certificate, and the application must contain the information required in subparagraph 3. Upon application for renewal, the certificate is subject to the review and reissuance procedures prescribed by this chapter and department rule.b. Each forwarding agent shall update its application information annually or within 30 days after any material change.c. The department shall verify that the forwarding agent is actively engaged in facilitating the international export of tangible personal property.d. The department may suspend or revoke the certificate of any forwarding agent that fails to respond within 30 days to a written request for information regarding its business transactions.10. The department shall provide a list on the department’s website of forwarding agents that have applied for and received a Florida Certificate of Forwarding Agent Address from the department. The list must include a forwarding agent’s entity name, address, and expiration date as provided on the Florida Certificate of Forwarding Agent Address.11. A dealer may accept a copy of the forwarding agent’s certificate or rely on the list of forwarding agents’ names and addresses on the department’s website in lieu of collecting the tax imposed under this chapter when the property is required by terms of the sale to be shipped to the designated address on the certificate. A dealer who accepts a valid copy of a certificate or relies on the list of forwarding agents’ names and addresses on the department’s website in good faith and ships purchased tangible personal property to the address on the certificate is not liable for any tax due on sales made during the effective dates indicated on the certificate.12. The department may revoke a forwarding agent’s certificate for noncompliance with this paragraph. Any person found to fraudulently use the address on the certificate for the purpose of evading tax is subject to the penalties provided in s. 212.085.13. The department may adopt rules to administer this paragraph, including, but not limited to, rules relating to procedures, application and eligibility requirements, and forms.

(c)1. Notwithstanding paragraph (a), it is not the intention of this chapter to levy a tax on the sale of tangible personal property to a nonresident dealer who does not hold a Florida sales tax registration, provided such nonresident dealer furnishes the seller a statement declaring that the tangible personal property will be transported outside this state by the nonresident dealer for resale and for no other purpose. The statement must include, but not be limited to, the nonresident dealer’s name, address, applicable passport or visa number, arrival-departure card number, and evidence of authority to do business in the nonresident dealer’s home state or country, such as his or her business name and address, occupational license number, if applicable, or any other suitable requirement. The statement must be signed by the nonresident dealer and must include the following sentence: “Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have read the foregoing, and the facts alleged are true to the best of my knowledge and belief.”2. The burden of proof of subparagraph 1. rests with the seller, who must retain the proper documentation to support the exempt sale. The exempt transaction is subject to verification by the department.

(d) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), it is not the intention of this chapter to levy a tax on the sale by a printer to a nonresident print purchaser of material printed by that printer for that nonresident print purchaser when the print purchaser does not furnish the printer a resale certificate containing a sales tax registration number but does furnish to the printer a statement declaring that such material will be resold by the nonresident print purchaser.

(8)(a) Use tax will apply and be due on tangible personal property imported or caused to be imported into this state for use, consumption, distribution, or storage to be used or consumed in this state; provided, however, that, except as provided in paragraph (b), it shall be presumed that tangible personal property used in another state, territory of the United States, or the District of Columbia for 6 months or longer before being imported into this state was not purchased for use in this state. The rental or lease of tangible personal property which is used or stored in this state shall be taxable without regard to its prior use or tax paid on purchase outside this state.

(b) The presumption that tangible personal property used in another state, territory of the United States, or the District of Columbia for 6 months or longer before being imported into this state was not purchased for use in this state does not apply to any boat for which a saltwater fishing license fee is required to be paid pursuant to s. 379.354(7), either directly or indirectly, for the purpose of taking, attempting to take, or possessing any saltwater fish for noncommercial purposes. Use tax shall apply and be due on such a boat as provided in this paragraph, and proof of payment of such tax must be presented prior to the first such licensure of the boat, registration of the boat pursuant to chapter 328, and titling of the boat pursuant to chapter 328. A boat that is first licensed within 1 year after purchase shall be subject to use tax on the full amount of the purchase price; a boat that is first licensed in the second year after purchase shall be subject to use tax on 90 percent of the purchase price; a boat that is first licensed in the third year after purchase shall be subject to use tax on 80 percent of the purchase price; a boat that is first licensed in the fourth year after purchase shall be subject to use tax on 70 percent of the purchase price; a boat that is first licensed in the fifth year after purchase shall be subject to use tax on 60 percent of the purchase price; and a boat that is first licensed in the sixth year after purchase, or later, shall be subject to use tax on 50 percent of the purchase price. If the purchaser fails to provide the purchase invoice on such boat, the fair market value of the boat at the time of importation into this state shall be used to compute the tax.

(11)(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the taxes imposed by this chapter shall not be imposed on promotional materials, which are imported, purchased, sold, used, manufactured, fabricated, processed, printed, imprinted, assembled, distributed, or stored in this state, if the promotional materials are subsequently exported outside this state, and regardless of whether the exportation process is continuous and unbroken, a separate consideration is charged for the material so exported, or the taxpayer keeps, retains, or exercises any right, power, dominion, or control over the promotional materials before or for the purpose of subsequently transporting them outside this state.

(b) As used in this subsection, the term promotional materials means tangible personal property that is given away or otherwise distributed to promote the sale of a subscription to a publication; written or printed advertising material, direct mail literature, correspondence, written solicitations, renewal notices, and billings for sales connected with or to promote the sale of a subscription to a publication; and the component parts of each of these types of promotional materials.

(c) This exemption inures to the taxpayer only through refund of previously paid taxes or by self-accruing taxes as provided in s. 212.183 and applies only where the seller of subscriptions to publications sold in the state:1. Is registered with the department pursuant to this chapter; and2. Remits the taxes imposed by this chapter on such publications.

(a) “Real property” means the land and improvements thereto and fixtures and is synonymous with the terms “realty” and “real estate.”

(b) “Fixtures” means items that are an accessory to a building, other structure, or land and that do not lose their identity as accessories when installed but that do become permanently attached to realty. However, the term does not include the following items, whether or not such items are attached to real property in a permanent manner: property of a type that is required to be registered, licensed, titled, or documented by this state or by the United States Government, including, but not limited to, mobile homes, except mobile homes assessed as real property, or industrial machinery or equipment. For purposes of this paragraph, industrial machinery or equipment is not limited to machinery and equipment used to manufacture, process, compound, or produce tangible personal property. For an item to be considered a fixture, it is not necessary that the owner of the item also own the real property to which it is attached.

(c) “Improvements to real property” includes the activities of building, erecting, constructing, altering, improving, repairing, or maintaining real property.

(15)(a) When a contractor secures rock, shell, fill dirt, or similar materials from a location that he or she owns or leases and uses such materials to fulfill a real property contract on the property of another person, the contractor is the ultimate consumer of such materials and is liable for use tax thereon. This paragraph does not apply to a person or a corporation or affiliated group as defined by s. 220.03(1)(b) or (e) that secures such materials from a location that he, she, or it owns for use on his, her, or its own property. The basis upon which the contractor shall remit the tax is the fair retail market value determined by establishing either the price he or she would have to pay for it on the open market or the price he or she would regularly charge if he or she sold it to other contractors or users.

(b) When a contractor does not own or lease the land but has entered into an agreement to purchase fill dirt, rock, shell, or similar materials for his or her own use and wherein the contractor will excavate and remove the material, the taxable basis shall include the cost of the material plus all costs of clearing, excavating, and removing, including labor and all other costs incurred by the contractor.

(c) In lieu of the method described in paragraph (a) for determining the taxable basis on rock, shell, fill dirt, and similar materials a contractor uses in performing a contract for the improvement of real property, the taxable basis may be calculated as the land cost plus all costs of clearing, excavating, and loading, including labor, power, blasting, and similar costs.

(d) No tax is applicable when the Department of Transportation furnishes without charge the borrow materials or the pits where materials are to be extracted for use on a road contract.

(16)(a) Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, the use by the publisher of a newspaper, magazine, or periodical of copies for his or her own consumption or to be given away is taxable at the usual retail price thereof, if any, or at the “cost price.”

(b) For the purposes of this subsection, the term “cost price” means the actual cost of printing of newspapers, magazines, and other publications, without any deductions therefrom on account of the cost of materials used, labor or services cost, transportation charges, or other direct or indirect overhead costs that are a part of printing costs of the property. However, the cost of labor to manufacture, produce, compound, process, or fabricate expendable items of tangible personal property which are directly used by such person in printing other tangible personal property for sale or for his or her own use is exempt. Authors’ royalties, fees, or salaries, general overhead, and other costs not directly related to printing shall be deemed to be labor associated with manufacturing, producing, compounding, processing, or fabricating expendable items.

(f) The application of the tax on a package that contains exempt food products and taxable nonfood products depends upon the essential character of the complete package.1. If the taxable items represent more than 25 percent of the cost of the complete package and a single charge is made, the entire sales price of the package is taxable. If the taxable items are separately stated, the separate charge for the taxable items is subject to tax.2. If the taxable items represent 25 percent or less of the cost of the complete package and a single charge is made, the entire sales price of the package is exempt from tax. The person preparing the package is liable for the tax on the cost of the taxable items going into the complete package. If the taxable items are separately stated, the separate charge is subject to tax.

In addition, any items intended for one-time use which transfer essential optical characteristics to contact lenses shall be exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter; however, this exemption shall apply only after $100,000 of the tax imposed by this chapter on such items has been paid in any calendar year by a taxpayer who claims the exemption in such year. Funeral directors shall pay tax on all tangible personal property used by them in their business.

(b) For the purposes of this subsection:1. “Prosthetic and orthopedic appliances” means any apparatus, instrument, device, or equipment used to replace or substitute for any missing part of the body, to alleviate the malfunction of any part of the body, or to assist any disabled person in leading a normal life by facilitating such person’s mobility.

The term also includes an orally transmitted order by the lawfully designated agent of such practitioner. The term also includes an order written or transmitted by a practitioner licensed to practice in a jurisdiction other than this state, but only if the pharmacist called upon to dispense such order determines, in the exercise of his or her professional judgment, that the order is valid and necessary for the treatment of a chronic or recurrent illness. The term also includes a pharmacist’s order for a product selected from the formulary created pursuant to s. 465.186. A prescription may be retained in written form, or the pharmacist may cause it to be recorded in a data processing system, provided that such order can be produced in printed form upon lawful request.

(k) Parts, special attachments, special lettering, and other like items that are added to or attached to tangible personal property so that a handicapped person can use them are exempt when such items are purchased by a person pursuant to an individual prescription.

1(l) Marijuana and marijuana delivery devices, as defined in s. 381.986, are exempt from the taxes imposed under this chapter.

(m) This subsection shall be strictly construed and enforced.

(a) The tax may not be imposed on the sale, rental, lease, use, consumption, repair, or storage for use in this state of power farm equipment or irrigation equipment, including replacement parts and accessories for power farm equipment or irrigation equipment, which are used exclusively on a farm or in a forest in the agricultural production of crops or products produced by those agricultural industries included in s. 570.02(1), or for fire prevention and suppression work with respect to such crops or products. Harvesting may not be construed to include processing activities. This exemption is not forfeited by moving farm equipment between farms or forests.

2(b) The tax may not be imposed on the sales price for a trailer purchased by a farmer for exclusive use in agricultural production or to transport farm products from his or her farm to the place where the farmer transfers ownership of the farm products to another. This exemption is not forfeited by using a trailer to transport the farmer’s farm equipment. The exemption provided under this paragraph does not apply to the lease or rental of a trailer.

(c) The exemptions provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) are not allowed unless the purchaser, renter, or lessee signs a certificate stating that the farm equipment is to be used exclusively as required under this subsection. Possession by a seller, lessor, or other dealer of a written certification by the purchaser, renter, or lessee certifying the purchaser’s, renter’s, or lessee’s entitlement to an exemption permitted by this subsection relieves the seller from the responsibility of collecting the tax on the nontaxable amounts, and the department shall look solely to the purchaser for recovery of such tax if it determines that the purchaser was not entitled to the exemption.

(a) Also exempt are:1. Water delivered to the purchaser through pipes or conduits or delivered for irrigation purposes. The sale of drinking water in bottles, cans, or other containers, including water that contains minerals or carbonation in its natural state or water to which minerals have been added at a water treatment facility regulated by the Department of Environmental Protection or the Department of Health, is exempt. This exemption does not apply to the sale of drinking water in bottles, cans, or other containers if carbonation or flavorings, except those added at a water treatment facility, have been added. Water that has been enhanced by the addition of minerals and that does not contain any added carbonation or flavorings is also exempt.2. All fuels used by a public or private utility, including any municipal corporation or rural electric cooperative association, in the generation of electric power or energy for sale. Fuel other than motor fuel and diesel fuel is taxable as provided in this chapter with the exception of fuel expressly exempt herein. Natural gas and natural gas fuel as defined in s. 206.9951(2) are exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter when placed into the fuel supply system of a motor vehicle. Effective July 1, 2013, natural gas used to generate electricity in a non-combustion fuel cell used in stationary equipment is exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter. Motor fuels and diesel fuels are taxable as provided in chapter 206, with the exception of those motor fuels and diesel fuels used by railroad locomotives or vessels to transport persons or property in interstate or foreign commerce, which are taxable under this chapter only to the extent provided herein. The basis of the tax shall be the ratio of intrastate mileage to interstate or foreign mileage traveled by the carrier’s railroad locomotives or vessels that were used in interstate or foreign commerce and that had at least some Florida mileage during the previous fiscal year of the carrier, such ratio to be determined at the close of the fiscal year of the carrier. However, during the fiscal year in which the carrier begins its initial operations in this state, the carrier’s mileage apportionment factor may be determined on the basis of an estimated ratio of anticipated miles in this state to anticipated total miles for that year, and subsequently, additional tax shall be paid on the motor fuel and diesel fuels, or a refund may be applied for, on the basis of the actual ratio of the carrier’s railroad locomotives’ or vessels’ miles in this state to its total miles for that year. This ratio shall be applied each month to the total Florida purchases made in this state of motor and diesel fuels to establish that portion of the total used and consumed in intrastate movement and subject to tax under this chapter. The basis for imposition of any discretionary surtax shall be set forth in s. 212.054. Fuels used exclusively in intrastate commerce do not qualify for the proration of tax.3. The transmission or wheeling of electricity.4. Dyed diesel fuel placed into the storage tank of a vessel used exclusively for the commercial fishing and aquacultural purposes listed in s. 206.41(4)(c)3.

(b) Alcoholic beverages and malt beverages are not exempt. The terms “alcoholic beverages” and “malt beverages” as used in this paragraph have the same meanings ascribed to them in ss. 561.01(4) and 563.01, respectively. It is determined by the Legislature that the classification of alcoholic beverages made in this paragraph for the purpose of extending the tax imposed by this chapter is reasonable and just, and it is intended that such tax be separate from, and in addition to, any other tax imposed on alcoholic beverages.

3(a) Items in agricultural use and certain nets.—There are exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter nets designed and used exclusively by commercial fisheries; disinfectants, fertilizers, insecticides, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and weed killers used for application on crops or groves, including commercial nurseries and home vegetable gardens, used in dairy barns or on poultry farms for the purpose of protecting poultry or livestock, or used directly on poultry or livestock; animal health products that are administered to, applied to, or consumed by livestock or poultry to alleviate pain or cure or prevent sickness, disease, or suffering, including, but not limited to, antiseptics, absorbent cotton, gauze for bandages, lotions, vaccines, vitamins, and worm remedies; aquaculture health products that are used by aquaculture producers, as defined in s. 597.0015, to prevent or treat fungi, bacteria, and parasitic diseases; portable containers or movable receptacles in which portable containers are placed, used for processing farm products; field and garden seeds, including flower seeds; nursery stock, seedlings, cuttings, or other propagative material purchased for growing stock; seeds, seedlings, cuttings, and plants used to produce food for human consumption; cloth, plastic, and other similar materials used for shade, mulch, or protection from frost or insects on a farm; hog wire and barbed wire fencing, including gates and materials used to construct or repair such fencing, used in agricultural production on lands classified as agricultural lands under s. 193.461; materials used to construct or repair permanent or temporary fencing used to contain, confine, or process cattle, including gates and energized fencing systems, used in agricultural operations on lands classified as agricultural lands under s. 193.461; stakes used by a farmer to support plants during agricultural production; generators used on poultry farms; and liquefied petroleum gas or other fuel used to heat a structure in which started pullets or broilers are raised; however, such exemption is not allowed unless the purchaser or lessee signs a certificate stating that the item to be exempted is for the exclusive use designated herein.

Such purchases must be made before the date the business first begins its productive operations, and delivery of the purchased item must be made within 12 months after that date.2. Industrial machinery and equipment purchased for exclusive use by an expanding facility which is engaged in spaceport activities as defined by s. 212.02 or for use in expanding manufacturing facilities or plant units which manufacture, process, compound, or produce for sale items of tangible personal property at fixed locations in this state are exempt from any amount of tax imposed by this chapter upon an affirmative showing by the taxpayer to the satisfaction of the department that such items are used to increase the productive output of such expanded facility or business by not less than 5 percent.3.a. To receive an exemption provided by subparagraph 1. or subparagraph 2., a qualifying business entity shall apply to the department for a temporary tax exemption permit. The application shall state that a new business exemption or expanded business exemption is being sought. Upon a tentative affirmative determination by the department pursuant to subparagraph 1. or subparagraph 2., the department shall issue such permit.b. The applicant shall maintain all necessary books and records to support the exemption. Upon completion of purchases of qualified machinery and equipment pursuant to subparagraph 1. or subparagraph 2., the temporary tax permit shall be delivered to the department or returned to the department by certified or registered mail.c. If, in a subsequent audit conducted by the department, it is determined that the machinery and equipment purchased as exempt under subparagraph 1. or subparagraph 2. did not meet the criteria mandated by this paragraph or if commencement of production did not occur, the amount of taxes exempted at the time of purchase shall immediately be due and payable to the department by the business entity, together with the appropriate interest and penalty, computed from the date of purchase, in the manner prescribed by this chapter.d. If a qualifying business entity fails to apply for a temporary exemption permit or if the tentative determination by the department required to obtain a temporary exemption permit is negative, a qualifying business entity shall receive the exemption provided in subparagraph 1. or subparagraph 2. through a refund of previously paid taxes. No refund may be made for such taxes unless the criteria mandated by subparagraph 1. or subparagraph 2. have been met and commencement of production has occurred.4. The department shall adopt rules governing applications for, issuance of, and the form of temporary tax exemption permits; provisions for recapture of taxes; and the manner and form of refund applications, and may establish guidelines as to the requisites for an affirmative showing of increased productive output, commencement of production, and qualification for exemption.5. The exemptions provided in subparagraphs 1. and 2. do not apply to machinery or equipment purchased or used by electric utility companies, communications companies, oil or gas exploration or production operations, publishing firms that do not export at least 50 percent of their finished product out of the state, any firm subject to regulation by the Division of Hotels and Restaurants of the Department of Business and Professional Regulation, or any firm that does not manufacture, process, compound, or produce for sale items of tangible personal property or that does not use such machinery and equipment in spaceport activities as required by this paragraph. The exemptions provided in subparagraphs 1. and 2. shall apply to machinery and equipment purchased for use in phosphate or other solid minerals severance, mining, or processing operations.6. For the purposes of the exemptions provided in subparagraphs 1. and 2., these terms have the following meanings:a. “Industrial machinery and equipment” means tangible personal property or other property that has a depreciable life of 3 years or more and that is used as an integral part in the manufacturing, processing, compounding, or production of tangible personal property for sale or is exclusively used in spaceport activities. A building and its structural components are not industrial machinery and equipment unless the building or structural component is so closely related to the industrial machinery and equipment that it houses or supports that the building or structural component can be expected to be replaced when the machinery and equipment are replaced. Heating and air-conditioning systems are not industrial machinery and equipment unless the sole justification for their installation is to meet the requirements of the production process, even though the system may provide incidental comfort to employees or serve, to an insubstantial degree, nonproduction activities. The term includes parts and accessories only to the extent that the exemption thereof is consistent with the provisions of this paragraph.b. “Productive output” means the number of units actually produced by a single plant, operation, or product line in a single continuous 12-month period, irrespective of sales. Increases in productive output shall be measured by the output for 12 continuous months selected by the expanding business after completion of the installation of such machinery or equipment over the output for the 12 continuous months immediately preceding such installation. However, in no case may such time period begin later than 2 years after completion of the installation of the new machinery and equipment. The units used to measure productive output shall be physically comparable between the two periods, irrespective of sales.

2(c) Machinery and equipment used in production of electrical or steam energy.—1. The purchase of machinery and equipment for use at a fixed location which machinery and equipment are necessary in the production of electrical or steam energy resulting from the burning of hydrogen or boiler fuels other than residual oil is exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter. Such electrical or steam energy must be primarily for use in manufacturing, processing, compounding, or producing for sale items of tangible personal property in this state. Use of a de minimis amount of residual fuel to facilitate the burning of nonresidual fuel shall not reduce the exemption otherwise available under this paragraph.2. In facilities where machinery and equipment are necessary to burn hydrogen, or both residual and nonresidual fuels, the exemption shall be prorated. Such proration shall be based upon the production of electrical or steam energy from nonresidual fuels and hydrogen as a percentage of electrical or steam energy from all fuels. If it is determined that 15 percent or less of all electrical or steam energy generated was produced by burning residual fuel, the full exemption shall apply. Purchasers claiming a partial exemption shall obtain such exemption by refund of taxes paid, or as otherwise provided in the department’s rules.3. The department may adopt rules that provide for implementation of this exemption. Purchasers of machinery and equipment qualifying for the exemption provided in this paragraph shall furnish the vendor with an affidavit stating that the item or items to be exempted are for the use designated herein. Any person furnishing a false affidavit to the vendor for the purpose of evading payment of any tax imposed under this chapter shall be subject to the penalty set forth in s. 212.085 and as otherwise provided by law. Purchasers with self-accrual authority shall maintain all documentation necessary to prove the exempt status of purchases.

(d) Machinery and equipment used under federal procurement contract.—1. Industrial machinery and equipment purchased by an expanding business which manufactures tangible personal property pursuant to federal procurement regulations at fixed locations in this state are exempt from the tax imposed in this chapter upon an affirmative showing by the taxpayer to the satisfaction of the department that such items are used to increase the implicit productive output of the expanded business by not less than 10 percent. The percentage of increase is measured as deflated implicit productive output for the calendar year during which the installation of the machinery or equipment is completed or during which commencement of production utilizing such items is begun divided by the implicit productive output for the preceding calendar year. In no case may the commencement of production begin later than 2 years following completion of installation of the machinery or equipment.2. The amount of the exemption allowed shall equal the taxes otherwise imposed by this chapter on qualifying industrial machinery or equipment reduced by the percentage of gross receipts from cost-reimbursement type contracts attributable to the plant or operation to total gross receipts so attributable, accrued for the year of completion or commencement.3. The exemption provided by this paragraph shall inure to the taxpayer only through refund of previously paid taxes. Such refund shall be made within 30 days of formal approval by the department of the taxpayer’s application, which application may be made on an annual basis following installation of the machinery or equipment.4. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term:a. “Cost-reimbursement type contracts” has the same meaning as in 432 C.F.R. s. 3-405.b. “Deflated implicit productive output” means the product of implicit productive output times the quotient of the national defense implicit price deflator for the preceding calendar year divided by the deflator for the year of completion or commencement.c. “Eligible costs” means the total direct and indirect costs, as defined in 532 C.F.R. ss. 15-202 and 15-203, excluding general and administrative costs, selling expenses, and profit, defined by the uniform cost-accounting standards adopted by the Cost-Accounting Standards Board created pursuant to 650 U.S.C. s. 2168.d. “Implicit productive output” means the annual eligible costs attributable to all contracts or subcontracts subject to federal procurement regulations of the single plant or operation at which the machinery or equipment is used.e. “Industrial machinery and equipment” means tangible personal property or other property that has a depreciable life of 3 years or more, that qualifies as an eligible cost under federal procurement regulations, and that is used as an integral part of the process of production of tangible personal property. A building and its structural components are not industrial machinery and equipment unless the building or structural component is so closely related to the industrial machinery and equipment that it houses or supports that the building or structural component can be expected to be replaced when the machinery and equipment are replaced. Heating and air-conditioning systems are not industrial machinery and equipment unless the sole justification for their installation is to meet the requirements of the production process, even though the system may provide incidental comfort to employees or serve, to an insubstantial degree, nonproduction activities. The term includes parts and accessories only to the extent that the exemption of such parts and accessories is consistent with the provisions of this paragraph.f. “National defense implicit price deflator” means the national defense implicit price deflator for the gross national product as determined by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United States Department of Commerce.5. The exclusions provided in subparagraph (b)5. apply to this exemption. This exemption applies only to machinery or equipment purchased pursuant to production contracts with the United States Department of Defense and Armed Forces, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and other federal agencies for which the contracts are classified for national security reasons. In no event shall the provisions of this paragraph apply to any expanding business the increase in productive output of which could be measured under the provisions of sub-subparagraph (b)6.b. as physically comparable between the two periods.

(e) Gas or electricity used for certain agricultural purposes.—1. Butane gas, propane gas, natural gas, and all other forms of liquefied petroleum gases are exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter if used in any tractor, vehicle, or other farm equipment which is used exclusively on a farm or for processing farm products on the farm and no part of which gas is used in any vehicle or equipment driven or operated on the public highways of this state, or if used in any tractor, vehicle, or other farm equipment that is used directly or indirectly for the production, packing, or processing of aquacultural products as defined in s. 597.0015. This restriction does not apply to the movement of farm vehicles or farm equipment between farms. The transporting of bees by water and the operating of equipment used in the apiary of a beekeeper is also deemed an exempt use.2. Electricity used directly or indirectly for production, packing, or processing of agricultural products on the farm, inclusive of the raising of aquaculture products as defined in s. 597.0015, or used directly or indirectly in a packinghouse, is exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter. As used in this subsection, the term “packinghouse” means any building or structure where fruits, vegetables, or meat from cattle or hogs or fish is packed or otherwise prepared for market or shipment in fresh form for wholesale distribution. The exemption does not apply to electricity used in buildings or structures where agricultural products are sold at retail. This exemption applies only if the electricity used for the exempt purposes is separately metered. If the electricity is not separately metered, it is conclusively presumed that some portion of the electricity is used for a nonexempt purpose, and all of the electricity used for such purposes is taxable. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “fish” means any of the numerous cold-blooded aquatic vertebrates of the superclass Pisces, characteristically having fins, gills, and a streamlined body, which are raised through aquaculture.

(f) Motion picture or video equipment used in motion picture or television production activities and sound recording equipment used in the production of master tapes and master records.—1. Motion picture or video equipment and sound recording equipment purchased or leased for use in this state in production activities is exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter. The exemption provided by this paragraph shall inure to the taxpayer upon presentation of the certificate of exemption issued to the taxpayer under the provisions of s. 288.1258.2. For the purpose of the exemption provided in subparagraph 1.:a. “Motion picture or video equipment” and “sound recording equipment” includes only tangible personal property or other property that has a depreciable life of 3 years or more and that is used by the lessee or purchaser exclusively as an integral part of production activities; however, motion picture or video equipment and sound recording equipment does not include supplies, tape, records, film, or video tape used in productions or other similar items; vehicles or vessels; or general office equipment not specifically suited to production activities. In addition, the term does not include equipment purchased or leased by television or radio broadcasting or cable companies licensed by the Federal Communications Commission. Furthermore, a building and its structural components are not motion picture or video equipment and sound recording equipment unless the building or structural component is so closely related to the motion picture or video equipment and sound recording equipment that it houses or supports that the building or structural component can be expected to be replaced when the motion picture or video equipment and sound recording equipment are replaced. Heating and air-conditioning systems are not motion picture or video equipment and sound recording equipment unless the sole justification for their installation is to meet the requirements of the production activities, even though the system may provide incidental comfort to employees or serve, to an insubstantial degree, nonproduction activities.b. “Production activities” means activities directed toward the preparation of a:(I) Master tape or master record embodying sound; or(II) Motion picture or television production which is produced for theatrical, commercial, advertising, or educational purposes and utilizes live or animated actions or a combination of live and animated actions. The motion picture or television production shall be commercially produced for sale or for showing on screens or broadcasting on television and may be on film or video tape.

(g) Building materials used in the rehabilitation of real property located in an enterprise zone.—1. Building materials used in the rehabilitation of real property located in an enterprise zone are exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter upon an affirmative showing to the satisfaction of the department that the items have been used for the rehabilitation of real property located in an enterprise zone. Except as provided in subparagraph 2., this exemption inures to the owner, lessee, or lessor at the time the real property is rehabilitated, but only through a refund of previously paid taxes. To receive a refund pursuant to this paragraph, the owner, lessee, or lessor of the rehabilitated real property must file an application under oath with the governing body or enterprise zone development agency having jurisdiction over the enterprise zone where the business is located, as applicable. A single application for a refund may be submitted for multiple, contiguous parcels that were part of a single parcel that was divided as part of the rehabilitation of the property. All other requirements of this paragraph apply to each parcel on an individual basis. The application must include:a. The name and address of the person claiming the refund.b. An address and assessment roll parcel number of the rehabilitated real property for which a refund of previously paid taxes is being sought.c. A description of the improvements made to accomplish the rehabilitation of the real property.d. A copy of a valid building permit issued by the county or municipal building department for the rehabilitation of the real property.e. A sworn statement, under penalty of perjury, from the general contractor licensed in this state with whom the applicant contracted to make the improvements necessary to rehabilitate the real property, which lists the building materials used to rehabilitate the real property, the actual cost of the building materials, and the amount of sales tax paid in this state on the building materials. If a general contractor was not used, the applicant, not a general contractor, shall make the sworn statement required by this sub-subparagraph. Copies of the invoices that evidence the purchase of the building materials used in the rehabilitation and the payment of sales tax on the building materials must be attached to the sworn statement provided by the general contractor or by the applicant. Unless the actual cost of building materials used in the rehabilitation of real property and the payment of sales taxes is documented by a general contractor or by the applicant in this manner, the cost of the building materials is deemed to be an amount equal to 40 percent of the increase in assessed value for ad valorem tax purposes.f. The identifying number assigned pursuant to s. 290.0065 to the enterprise zone in which the rehabilitated real property is located.g. A certification by the local building code inspector that the improvements necessary to rehabilitate the real property are substantially completed.h. A statement of whether the business is a small business as defined by s. 288.703.i. If applicable, the name and address of each permanent employee of the business, including, for each employee who is a resident of an enterprise zone, the identifying number assigned pursuant to s. 290.0065 to the enterprise zone in which the employee resides.2. This exemption inures to a municipality, county, other governmental unit or agency, or nonprofit community-based organization through a refund of previously paid taxes if the building materials used in the rehabilitation are paid for from the funds of a community development block grant, State Housing Initiatives Partnership Program, or similar grant or loan program. To receive a refund, a municipality, county, other governmental unit or agency, or nonprofit community-based organization must file an application that includes the same information required in subparagraph 1. In addition, the application must include a sworn statement signed by the chief executive officer of the municipality, county, other governmental unit or agency, or nonprofit community-based organization seeking a refund which states that the building materials for which a refund is sought were funded by a community development block grant, State Housing Initiatives Partnership Program, or similar grant or loan program.3. Within 10 working days after receipt of an application, the governing body or enterprise zone development agency shall review the application to determine if it contains all the information required by subparagraph 1. or subparagraph 2. and meets the criteria set out in this paragraph. The governing body or agency shall certify all applications that contain the required information and are eligible to receive a refund. If applicable, the governing body or agency shall also certify if 20 percent of the employees of the business are residents of an enterprise zone, excluding temporary and part-time employees. The certification must be in writing, and a copy of the certification shall be transmitted to the executive director of the department. The applicant is responsible for forwarding a certified application to the department within the time specified in subparagraph 4.4. An application for a refund must be submitted to the department within 6 months after the rehabilitation of the property is deemed to be substantially completed by the local building code inspector or by November 1 after the rehabilitated property is first subject to assessment.5. Only one exemption through a refund of previously paid taxes for the rehabilitation of real property is permitted for any single parcel of property unless there is a change in ownership, a new lessor, or a new lessee of the real property.

However, for sales of tangible personal property that go into or become a part of public works owned by a governmental entity, other than the Federal Government, a governmental entity claiming the exemption provided under this subsection shall certify to the dealer and the contractor the entity’s claim to the exemption by providing the dealer and the contractor a certificate of entitlement to the exemption for such sales. If the department later determines that such sales, in which the governmental entity provided the dealer and the contractor with a certificate of entitlement to the exemption, were not exempt sales to the governmental entity, the governmental entity shall be liable for any tax, penalty, and interest determined to be owed on such transactions. Possession by a dealer or contractor of a certificate of entitlement to the exemption from the governmental entity relieves the dealer from the responsibility of collecting tax on the sale and the contractor for any liability for tax, penalty, or interest related to the sale, and the department shall look solely to the governmental entity for recovery of tax, penalty, and interest if the department determines that the transaction was not an exempt sale to the governmental entity. The governmental entity may not transfer liability for such tax, penalty, and interest to another party by contract or agreement.

(c) The department shall adopt rules for determining whether a particular transaction is properly characterized as an exempt sale to a governmental entity or a taxable sale to a contractor which give special consideration to factors that govern the status of the tangible personal property before being affixed to real property. In developing such rules, assumption of the risk of damage or loss is of paramount consideration in the determination. The department shall also adopt, by rule, a certificate of entitlement to exemption for use as provided in paragraph (b). The certificate shall require the governmental entity to affirm that it will comply with the requirements of this subsection and the rules adopted under paragraph (b) in order to qualify for the exemption and that it acknowledges its liability for any tax, penalty, or interest later determined by the department to be owed on such transactions.

The ratio would be determined at the close of the carrier’s fiscal year. However, during the fiscal year in which the vessel begins its initial operations in this state, the vessel’s mileage apportionment factor may be determined on the basis of an estimated ratio of anticipated miles in this state to anticipated total miles for that year and, subsequently, additional tax shall be paid on the vessel, or a refund may be applied for, on the basis of the actual ratio of the vessel’s miles in this state to its total miles for that year.

(b) “Department” means the Department of Revenue.

(c) “Expanded facility” means a Florida renewable energy facility that increases its electrical production and sale by more than 5 percent above the facility’s electrical production and sale during the 2011 calendar year.

(d) “Florida renewable energy facility” means a facility in the state that produces electricity for sale from renewable energy.

(e) “New facility” means a Florida renewable energy facility that is operationally placed in service after May 1, 2006. The term includes a Florida renewable energy facility that has had an expansion operationally placed in service after May 1, 2006, and whose cost exceeded 50 percent of the assessed value of the facility immediately before the expansion.

(f) “Sale” or “sold” includes the use of electricity by the producer of such electricity which decreases the amount of electricity that the producer would otherwise have to purchase.

(g) “Taxpayer” includes a general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, trust, or other artificial entity in which a corporation, as defined in s. 220.03(1)(e), owns an interest and is taxed as a partnership or is disregarded as a separate entity from the corporation under this chapter.

(a) The credit shall be $0.01 for each kilowatt-hour of electricity produced and sold by the taxpayer to an unrelated party during a given tax year.

(b) The credit may be claimed for electricity produced and sold on or after January 1, 2013. Beginning in 2014 and continuing until 2017, each taxpayer claiming a credit under this section must apply to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services by the date established by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services for an allocation of available credits for that year. The application form shall be adopted by rule of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services in consultation with the commission. The application form shall, at a minimum, require a sworn affidavit from each taxpayer certifying the increase in production and sales that form the basis of the application and certifying that all information contained in the application is true and correct.

(c) If the amount of credits applied for each year exceeds the amount authorized in paragraph (g), the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services shall allocate credits to qualified applicants based on the following priority:1. An applicant who places a new facility in operation after May 1, 2012, shall be allocated credits first, up to a maximum of $250,000 each, with any remaining credits to be granted pursuant to subparagraph 3., but if the claims for credits under this subparagraph exceed the state fiscal year cap in paragraph (g), credits shall be allocated pursuant to this subparagraph on a prorated basis based upon each applicant’s qualified production and sales as a percentage of total production and sales for all applicants in this category for the fiscal year.2. An applicant who does not qualify under subparagraph 1. but who claims a credit of $50,000 or less shall be allocated credits next, but if the claims for credits under this subparagraph, combined with credits allocated in subparagraph 1., exceed the state fiscal year cap in paragraph (g), credits shall be allocated pursuant to this subparagraph on a prorated basis based upon each applicant’s qualified production and sales as a percentage of total qualified production and sales for all applicants in this category for the fiscal year.3. An applicant who does not qualify under subparagraph 1. or subparagraph 2. and an applicant whose credits have not been fully allocated under subparagraph 1. shall be allocated credits next. If there is insufficient capacity within the amount authorized for the state fiscal year in paragraph (g), and after allocations pursuant to subparagraphs 1. and 2., the credits allocated under this subparagraph shall be prorated based upon each applicant’s unallocated claims for qualified production and sales as a percentage of total unallocated claims for qualified production and sales of all applicants in this category, up to a maximum of $1 million per taxpayer per state fiscal year. If, after application of this $1 million cap, there is excess capacity under the state fiscal year cap in paragraph (g) in any state fiscal year, that remaining capacity shall be used to allocate additional credits with priority given in the order set forth in this subparagraph and without regard to the $1 million per taxpayer cap.

(d) If the credit granted pursuant to this section is not fully used in 1 year because of insufficient tax liability on the part of the taxpayer, the unused amount may be carried forward for a period not to exceed 5 years. The carryover credit may be used in a subsequent year when the tax imposed by this chapter for such year exceeds the credit for such year, after applying the other credits and unused credit carryovers in the order provided in s. 220.02(8).

(e) A taxpayer that files a consolidated return in this state as a member of an affiliated group under s. 220.131(1) may be allowed the credit on a consolidated return basis up to the amount of tax imposed upon the consolidated group.

(f)1. Tax credits that may be available under this section to an entity eligible under this section may be transferred after a merger or acquisition to the surviving or acquiring entity and used in the same manner with the same limitations.2. The entity or its surviving or acquiring entity as described in subparagraph 1. may transfer any unused credit in whole or in units of no less than 25 percent of the remaining credit. The entity acquiring such credit may use it in the same manner and with the same limitations under this section. Such transferred credits may not be transferred again although they may succeed to a surviving or acquiring entity subject to the same conditions and limitations as described in this section.3. In the event the credit provided for under this section is reduced as a result of an examination or audit by the department, such tax deficiency shall be recovered from the first entity or the surviving or acquiring entity to have claimed such credit up to the amount of credit taken. Any subsequent deficiencies shall be assessed against any entity acquiring and claiming such credit, or in the case of multiple succeeding entities in the order of credit succession.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, credits for the production and sale of electricity from a new or expanded Florida renewable energy facility may be earned between January 1, 2013, and June 30, 2016. The combined total amount of tax credits which may be granted for all taxpayers under this section is limited to $5 million in state fiscal year 2012-2013 and $10 million per state fiscal year in state fiscal years 2013-2014 through 2016-2017. If the annual tax credit authorization amount is not exhausted by allocations of credits within that particular state fiscal year, any authorized but unallocated credit amounts may be used to grant credits that were earned pursuant to 1s. 220.192 but unallocated due to a lack of authorized funds.

(h) A taxpayer claiming a credit under this section shall be required to add back to net income that portion of its business deductions claimed on its federal return paid or incurred for the taxable year which is equal to the amount of the credit allowable for the taxable year under this section.

(i) When an entity treated as a partnership or a disregarded entity under this chapter produces and sells electricity from a new or expanded renewable energy facility, the credit earned by such entity shall pass through in the same manner as items of income and expense pass through for federal income tax purposes. When an entity applies for the credit and the entity has received the credit by a pass-through, the application must identify the taxpayer that passed the credit through, all taxpayers that received the credit, and the percentage of the credit that passes through to each recipient and must provide other information that the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services requires.

(j) A taxpayer’s use of the credit granted pursuant to this section does not reduce the amount of any credit available to such taxpayer under s. 220.186.

(5)(a) In addition to its existing audit and investigation authority, the Department of Revenue may perform any additional financial and technical audits and investigations, including examining the accounts, books, and records of the tax credit applicant, which are necessary to verify the information included in the tax credit return and to ensure compliance with this section. The Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services shall provide technical assistance when requested by the Department of Revenue on any technical audits or examinations performed pursuant to this section.

(b) It is grounds for forfeiture of previously claimed and received tax credits if the Department of Revenue determines, as a result of an audit or examination or from information received from the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, that a taxpayer received tax credits pursuant to this section to which the taxpayer was not entitled. The taxpayer is responsible for returning forfeited tax credits to the Department of Revenue, and such funds shall be paid into the General Revenue Fund of the state.

(c) The Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services may revoke or modify any written decision granting eligibility for tax credits under this section if it is discovered that the tax credit applicant submitted any false statement, representation, or certification in any application, record, report, plan, or other document filed in an attempt to receive tax credits under this section. The Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services shall immediately notify the Department of Revenue of any revoked or modified orders affecting previously granted tax credits. Additionally, the taxpayer must notify the Department of Revenue of any change in its tax credit claimed.

(d) The taxpayer shall file with the Department of Revenue an amended return or such other report as the Department of Revenue prescribes by rule and shall pay any required tax and interest within 60 days after the taxpayer receives notification from the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services that previously approved tax credits have been revoked or modified. If the revocation or modification order is contested, the taxpayer shall file an amended return or other report as provided in this paragraph within 60 days after a final order is issued after proceedings.

(e) A notice of deficiency may be issued by the Department of Revenue at any time within 3 years after the taxpayer receives formal notification from the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services that previously approved tax credits have been revoked or modified. If a taxpayer fails to notify the Department of Revenue of any changes to its tax credit claimed, a notice of deficiency may be issued at any time.

"(1)(a) The department and local governmental entities, referred to in this section and in ss. 337.402-337.404 as the “authority,” that have jurisdiction and control of public roads or publicly owned rail corridors are authorized to prescribe and enforce reasonable rules or regulations with reference to the placing and maintaining across, on, or within the right-of-way limits of any road or publicly owned rail corridors under their respective jurisdictions any electric transmission, voice, telegraph, data, or other communications services lines or wireless facilities; pole lines; poles; railways; ditches; sewers; water, heat, or gas mains; pipelines; fences; gasoline tanks and pumps; or other structures referred to in this section and in ss. 337.402-337.404 as the “utility.” The department may enter into a permit-delegation agreement with a governmental entity if issuance of a permit is based on requirements that the department finds will ensure the safety and integrity of facilities of the Department of Transportation; however, the permit-delegation agreement does not apply to facilities of electric utilities as defined in s. 366.02(4).

(b) For aerial and underground electric utility transmission lines designed to operate at 69 or more kilovolts that are needed to accommodate the additional electrical transfer capacity on the transmission grid resulting from new base-load generating facilities, the department’s rules shall provide for placement of and access to such transmission lines adjacent to and within the right-of-way of any department-controlled public roads, including longitudinally within limited access facilities where there is no other practicable alternative available, to the greatest extent allowed by federal law, if compliance with the standards established by such rules is achieved. Without limiting or conditioning the department’s jurisdiction or authority described in paragraph (a), with respect to limited access right-of-way, such rules may include, but need not be limited to, that the use of the right-of-way for longitudinal placement of electric utility transmission lines is reasonable based upon a consideration of economic and environmental factors, including, without limitation, other practicable alternative alignments, utility corridors and easements, impacts on adjacent property owners, and minimum clear zones and other safety standards, and further provide that placement of the electric utility transmission lines within the department’s right-of-way does not interfere with operational requirements of the transportation facility or planned or potential future expansion of such transportation facility. If the department approves longitudinal placement of electric utility transmission lines in limited access facilities, compensation for the use of the right-of-way is required. Such consideration or compensation paid by the electric utility in connection with the department’s issuance of a permit does not create any property right in the department’s property regardless of the amount of consideration paid or the improvements constructed on the property by the utility. Upon notice by the department that the property is needed for expansion or improvement of the transportation facility, the electric utility transmission line will be removed or relocated at the electric utility’s sole expense. The electric utility shall pay to the department reasonable damages resulting from the utility’s failure or refusal to timely remove or relocate its transmission lines. The rules to be adopted by the department may also address the compensation methodology and removal or relocation. As used in this subsection, the term “base-load generating facilities” means electric power plants that are certified under part II of chapter 403.

(3)(a) Because of the unique circumstances applicable to providers of communications services, including, but not limited to, the circumstances described in paragraph (e) and the fact that federal and state law require the nondiscriminatory treatment of providers of telecommunications services, and because of the desire to promote competition among providers of communications services, it is the intent of the Legislature that municipalities and counties treat providers of communications services in a nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral manner when imposing rules or regulations governing the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public roads or rights-of-way. Rules or regulations imposed by a municipality or county relating to providers of communications services placing or maintaining communications facilities in its roads or rights-of-way must be generally applicable to all providers of communications services, taking into account the distinct engineering, construction, operation, maintenance, public works, and safety requirements of the provider’s facilities, and, notwithstanding any other law, may not require a provider of communications services to apply for or enter into an individual license, franchise, or other agreement with the municipality or county as a condition of placing or maintaining communications facilities in its roads or rights-of-way. In addition to other reasonable rules or regulations that a municipality or county may adopt relating to the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in its roads or rights-of-way under this subsection or subsection (7), a municipality or county may require a provider of communications services that places or seeks to place facilities in its roads or rights-of-way to register with the municipality or county. To register, a provider of communications services may be required only to provide its name; the name, address, and telephone number of a contact person for the registrant; the number of the registrant’s current certificate of authorization issued by the Florida Public Service Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, or the Department of State; a statement of whether the registrant is a pass-through provider as defined in subparagraph (6)(a)1.; the registrant’s federal employer identification number; and any required proof of insurance or self-insuring status adequate to defend and cover claims. A municipality or county may not require a registrant to renew a registration more frequently than every 5 years but may require during this period that a registrant update the registration information provided under this subsection within 90 days after a change in such information. A municipality or county may not require the registrant to provide an inventory of communications facilities, maps, locations of such facilities, or other information by a registrant as a condition of registration, renewal, or for any other purpose; provided, however, that a municipality or county may require as part of a permit application that the applicant identify at-grade communications facilities within 50 feet of the proposed installation location for the placement of at-grade communications facilities. A municipality or county may not require a provider to pay any fee, cost, or other charge for registration or renewal thereof. It is the intent of the Legislature that the placement, operation, maintenance, upgrading, and extension of communications facilities not be unreasonably interrupted or delayed through the permitting or other local regulatory process. Except as provided in this chapter or otherwise expressly authorized by chapter 202, chapter 364, or chapter 610, a municipality or county may not adopt or enforce any ordinance, regulation, or requirement as to the placement or operation of communications facilities in a right-of-way by a communications services provider authorized by state or local law to operate in a right-of-way; regulate any communications services; or impose or collect any tax, fee, cost, charge, or exaction for the provision of communications services over the communications services provider’s communications facilities in a right-of-way.

(b) Registration described in paragraph (a) does not establish a right to place or maintain, or priority for the placement or maintenance of, a communications facility in roads or rights-of-way of a municipality or county. Each municipality and county retains the authority to regulate and manage municipal and county roads or rights-of-way in exercising its police power, subject to the limitations imposed in this section and chapters 202 and 610. Any rules or regulations adopted by a municipality or county which govern the occupation of its roads or rights-of-way by providers of communications services must be related to the placement or maintenance of facilities in such roads or rights-of-way, must be reasonable and nondiscriminatory, and may include only those matters necessary to manage the roads or rights-of-way of the municipality or county.

(c) Any municipality or county that, as of January 1, 2019, elected to require permit fees from any provider of communications services that uses or occupies municipal or county roads or rights-of-way pursuant to former paragraph (c) or former paragraph (j), Florida Statutes 2018, may continue to require and collect such fees. A municipality or county that elected as of January 1, 2019, to require permit fees may elect to forego such fees as provided herein. A municipality or county that elected as of January 1, 2019, not to require permit fees may not elect to impose permit fees. All fees authorized under this paragraph must be reasonable and commensurate with the direct and actual cost of the regulatory activity, including issuing and processing permits, plan reviews, physical inspection, and direct administrative costs; must be demonstrable; and must be equitable among users of the roads or rights-of-way. A fee authorized under this paragraph may not be offset against the tax imposed under chapter 202; include the costs of roads or rights-of-way acquisition or roads or rights-of-way rental; include any general administrative, management, or maintenance costs of the roads or rights-of-way; or be based on a percentage of the value or costs associated with the work to be performed on the roads or rights-of-way. In an action to recover amounts due for a fee not authorized under this paragraph, the prevailing party may recover court costs and attorney fees at trial and on appeal. In addition to the limitations set forth in this section, a fee levied by a municipality or charter county under this paragraph may not exceed $100. However, permit fees may not be imposed with respect to permits that may be required for service drop lines not required to be noticed under s. 556.108(5) or for any activity that does not require the physical disturbance of the roads or rights-of-way or does not impair access to or full use of the roads or rights-of-way, including, but not limited to, the performance of service restoration work on existing facilities, extensions of such facilities for providing communications services to customers, and the placement of micro wireless facilities in accordance with subparagraph (7)(e)3.1. If a municipality or charter county elects to not require permit fees, the total rate for the local communications services tax as computed under s. 202.20 for that municipality or charter county may be increased by ordinance or resolution by an amount not to exceed a rate of 0.12 percent.2. If a noncharter county elects to not require permit fees, the total rate for the local communications services tax as computed under s. 202.20 for that noncharter county may be increased by ordinance or resolution by an amount not to exceed a rate of 0.24 percent, to replace the revenue the noncharter county would otherwise have received from permit fees for providers of communications services.

(d) In addition to any other notice requirements, a municipality must provide to the Secretary of State, at least 10 days prior to consideration on first reading, notice of a proposed ordinance governing a telecommunications company placing or maintaining telecommunications facilities in its roads or rights-of-way. In addition to any other notice requirements, a county must provide to the Secretary of State, at least 15 days prior to consideration at a public hearing, notice of a proposed ordinance governing a telecommunications company placing or maintaining telecommunications facilities in its roads or rights-of-way. The notice required by this paragraph must be published by the Secretary of State on a designated Internet website. The failure of a municipality or county to provide such notice does not render the ordinance invalid, provided that enforcement of such ordinance must be suspended until 30 days after the municipality or county provides the required notice.

(e) The authority of municipalities and counties to require franchise fees from providers of communications services, with respect to the provision of communications services, is specifically preempted by the state because of unique circumstances applicable to providers of communications services when compared to other utilities occupying municipal or county roads or rights-of-way. Providers of communications services may provide similar services in a manner that requires the placement of facilities in municipal or county roads or rights-of-way or in a manner that does not require the placement of facilities in such roads or rights-of-way. Although similar communications services may be provided by different means, the state desires to treat providers of communications services in a nondiscriminatory manner and to have the taxes, franchise fees, and other fees, costs, and financial or regulatory exactions paid by or imposed on providers of communications services be competitively neutral. Municipalities and counties retain all existing authority, if any, to collect franchise fees from users or occupants of municipal or county roads or rights-of-way other than providers of communications services, and the provisions of this subsection shall have no effect upon this authority. The provisions of this subsection do not restrict the authority, if any, of municipalities or counties or other governmental entities to receive reasonable rental fees based on fair market value for the use of public lands and buildings on property outside the public roads or rights-of-way for the placement of communications antennas and towers.

(f) Except as expressly allowed or authorized by general law and except for the rights-of-way permit fees subject to paragraph (c), a municipality or county may not levy on a provider of communications services a tax, fee, or other charge or imposition for operating as a provider of communications services within the jurisdiction of the municipality or county which is in any way related to using its roads or rights-of-way. A municipality or county may not require or solicit in-kind compensation, except as otherwise provided in s. 202.24(2)(c)8., provided that the in-kind compensation is not a franchise fee under federal law. Nothing in this paragraph impairs the authority of a municipality or county to request public, educational, or governmental access channels pursuant to s. 610.109. Nothing in this paragraph shall impair any ordinance or agreement in effect on May 22, 1998, or any voluntary agreement entered into subsequent to that date, which provides for or allows in-kind compensation by a telecommunications company.

(g) A municipality or county may not use its authority over the placement of facilities in its roads and rights-of-way as a basis for asserting or exercising regulatory control over a provider of communications services regarding matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Florida Public Service Commission or the Federal Communications Commission, including, but not limited to, the operations, systems, equipment, technology, qualifications, services, service quality, service territory, and prices of a provider of communications services. A municipality or county may not require any permit for the maintenance, repair, replacement, extension, or upgrade of existing aerial wireline communications facilities on utility poles or for aerial wireline facilities between existing wireline communications facility attachments on utility poles by a communications services provider. However, a municipality or county may require a right-of-way permit for work that involves excavation, closure of a sidewalk, or closure of a vehicular lane or parking lane, unless the provider is performing service restoration to existing facilities. A permit application required by an authority under this section for the placement of communications facilities must be processed and acted upon consistent with the timeframes provided in subparagraphs (7)(d)7., 8., and 9. In addition, a municipality or county may not require any permit or other approval, fee, charge, or cost, or other exaction for the maintenance, repair, replacement, extension, or upgrade of existing aerial lines or underground communications facilities located on private property outside of the public rights-of-way. As used in this section, the term “extension of existing facilities” includes those extensions from the rights-of-way into a customer’s private property for purposes of placing a service drop or those extensions from the rights-of-way into a utility easement to provide service to a discrete identifiable customer or group of customers.

(h) A provider of communications services that has obtained permission to occupy the roads or rights-of-way of an incorporated municipality pursuant to s. 362.01 or that is otherwise lawfully occupying the roads or rights-of-way of a municipality or county shall not be required to obtain consent to continue such lawful occupation of those roads or rights-of-way; however, nothing in this paragraph shall be interpreted to limit the power of a municipality or county to adopt or enforce reasonable rules or regulations as provided in this section and consistent with chapters 202, 364, and 610. Any such rules or regulations must be in writing, and registered providers of communications services in the municipality or county must be given at least 60 days’ advance written notice of any changes to the rules and regulations.

(i) Except as expressly provided in this section, this section does not modify the authority of municipalities and counties to levy the tax authorized in chapter 202 or the duties of providers of communications services under ss. 337.402-337.404. This section does not apply to building permits, pole attachments, or private roads, private easements, and private rights-of-way.

(j) Notwithstanding the provisions of s. 202.19, when a local communications services tax rate is changed as a result of an election made or changed under this subsection, such rate may not be rounded to tenths.

(6)(a) As used in this subsection, the following definitions apply:1.a. A “pass-through provider” is any person who places or maintains a communications facility in the roads or rights-of-way of a municipality or county that levies a tax pursuant to chapter 202 and who does not remit taxes imposed by that municipality or county pursuant to chapter 202.b. Notwithstanding sub-subparagraph a., a person who does not remit taxes imposed by a municipality or county pursuant to chapter 202, but pursuant to s. 202.16(2) sells communications services for resale to a person who sells such services at retail or who integrates such services into communications services sold at retail in that municipality or county and who remits taxes imposed by that municipality or county pursuant to chapter 202, is not a pass-through provider.2. A “communications facility” is a facility that may be used to provide communications services. Multiple cables, conduits, strands, or fibers located within the same conduit shall be considered one communications facility for purposes of this subsection.

(b) A municipality that levies a tax pursuant to chapter 202 may charge a pass-through provider that places or maintains a communications facility in the municipality’s roads or rights-of-way an annual amount not to exceed $500 per linear mile or portion thereof. A municipality’s roads or rights-of-way do not include roads or rights-of-way that extend in or through the municipality but are state, county, or another authority’s roads or rights-of-way.

(c) A county that levies a tax pursuant to chapter 202 may charge a pass-through provider that places or maintains a communications facility in the county’s roads or rights-of-way, including county roads or rights-of-way within a municipality in the county, an annual amount not to exceed $500 per linear mile or portion thereof. However, a county shall not impose a charge for any linear miles, or portions thereof, of county roads or rights-of-way where a communications facility is placed that extend through any municipality within the county to which the pass-through provider remits a tax imposed pursuant to chapter 202. A county’s roads or rights-of-way do not include roads or rights-of-way that extend in or through the county but are state, municipal, or another authority’s roads or rights-of-way.

(d) The amounts charged pursuant to this subsection shall be based on the linear miles of roads or rights-of-way where a communications facility is placed, not based on a summation of the lengths of individual cables, conduits, strands, or fibers. The amounts referenced in this subsection may be charged only once annually and only to one person annually for any communications facility. A municipality or county shall discontinue charging such amounts to a person that has ceased to be a pass-through provider. Any annual amounts charged shall be reduced for a prorated portion of any 12-month period during which the person remits taxes imposed by the municipality or county pursuant to chapter 202. Any excess amounts paid to a municipality or county shall be refunded to the person upon written notice of the excess to the municipality or county. A municipality or county may require a pass-through provider to provide an annual notarized statement identifying the total number of linear miles of pass-through facilities in the municipality’s or county’s rights-of-way. Upon request from a municipality or county, a pass-through provider must provide reasonable access to maps of pass-through facilities located in the rights-of-way of the municipality or county making the request. The scope of the request must be limited to only those maps of pass-through facilities from which the calculation of the linear miles of pass-through facilities in the rights-of-way can be determined. The request must be accompanied by an affidavit that the person making the request is authorized by the municipality or county to review tax information related to the revenue and mileage calculations for pass-through providers. A request may not be made more than once annually to a pass-through provider.

(e) This subsection does not alter any provision of this section or s. 202.24 relating to taxes, fees, or other charges or impositions by a municipality or county on a dealer of communications services or authorize that any charges be assessed on a dealer of communications services, except as specifically set forth herein. A municipality or county may not charge a pass-through provider any amounts other than the charges under this subsection as a condition to the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in the roads or rights-of-way of a municipality or county by a pass-through provider, except that a municipality or county may impose permit fees on a pass-through provider consistent with paragraph (3)(c).

(f) The charges under this subsection do not apply to communications facilities placed in a municipality’s or county’s rights-of-way prior to the effective date of this subsection with permission from the municipality or county, if any was required, except to the extent the facilities of a pass-through provider were subject to per linear foot or mile charges in effect as of October 1, 2001, in which case the municipality or county may only impose on a pass-through provider charges consistent with paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) for such facilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this subsection does not impair any written agreement between a pass-through provider and a municipality or county imposing per linear foot or mile charges for communications facilities placed in municipal or county roads or rights-of-way that is in effect prior to the effective date of this subsection. Upon the termination or expiration of any such written agreement, any charges imposed must be consistent with this section.

(g) The charges authorized in this subsection shall not be applied with respect to any communications facility that is used exclusively for the internal communications of an electric utility or other person in the business of transmitting or distributing electric energy.

The term does not include:a. The structure or improvements on, under, within, or adjacent to the structure on which the equipment is collocated;b. Wireline backhaul facilities; orc. Coaxial or fiber-optic cable that is between wireless structures or utility poles or that is otherwise not immediately adjacent to or directly associated with a particular antenna.13. “Wireless infrastructure provider” means a person who has been certificated under chapter 364 to provide telecommunications service or under chapter 610 to provide cable or video services in this state, or that person’s affiliate, and who builds or installs wireless communication transmission equipment, wireless facilities, or wireless support structures but is not a wireless services provider.14. “Wireless provider” means a wireless infrastructure provider or a wireless services provider.15. “Wireless services” means any services provided using licensed or unlicensed spectrum, whether at a fixed location or mobile, using wireless facilities.16. “Wireless services provider” means a person who provides wireless services.17. “Wireless support structure” means a freestanding structure, such as a monopole, a guyed or self-supporting tower, or another existing or proposed structure designed to support or capable of supporting wireless facilities. The term does not include a utility pole, pedestal, or other support structure for ground-based equipment not mounted on a utility pole and less than 5 feet in height.

(c) Except as provided in this subsection, an authority may not prohibit, regulate, or charge for the collocation of small wireless facilities in the public rights-of-way or for the installation, maintenance, modification, operation, or replacement of utility poles used for the collocation of small wireless facilities in the public rights-of-way.

(d) An authority may require a registration process and permit fees in accordance with subsection (3). An authority shall accept applications for permits and shall process and issue permits subject to the following requirements:1. An authority may not directly or indirectly require an applicant to perform services unrelated to the collocation for which approval is sought, such as in-kind contributions to the authority, including reserving fiber, conduit, or pole space for the authority.2. An applicant may not be required to provide more information to obtain a permit than is necessary to demonstrate the applicant’s compliance with applicable codes for the placement of small wireless facilities in the locations identified in the application. An applicant may not be required to provide inventories, maps, or locations of communications facilities in the right-of-way other than as necessary to avoid interference with other at-grade or aerial facilities located at the specific location proposed for a small wireless facility or within 50 feet of such location.3. An authority may not:a. Require the placement of small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole or category of poles;b. Require the placement of multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole;c. Require a demonstration that collocation of a small wireless facility on an existing structure is not legally or technically possible as a condition for granting a permit for the collocation of a small wireless facility on a new utility pole except as provided in paragraph (i);d. Require compliance with an authority’s provisions regarding placement of small wireless facilities or a new utility pole used to support a small wireless facility in rights-of-way under the control of the department unless the authority has received a delegation from the department for the location of the small wireless facility or utility pole, or require such compliance as a condition to receive a permit that is ancillary to the permit for collocation of a small wireless facility, including an electrical permit;e. Require a meeting before filing an application;f. Require direct or indirect public notification or a public meeting for the placement of communication facilities in the right-of-way;g. Limit the size or configuration of a small wireless facility or any of its components, if the small wireless facility complies with the size limits in this subsection;h. Prohibit the installation of a new utility pole used to support the collocation of a small wireless facility if the installation otherwise meets the requirements of this subsection; ori. Require that any component of a small wireless facility be placed underground except as provided in paragraph (i).4. Subject to paragraph (r), an authority may not limit the placement, by minimum separation distances, of small wireless facilities, utility poles on which small wireless facilities are or will be collocated, or other at-grade communications facilities. However, within 14 days after the date of filing the application, an authority may request that the proposed location of a small wireless facility be moved to another location in the right-of-way and placed on an alternative authority utility pole or support structure or placed on a new utility pole. The authority and the applicant may negotiate the alternative location, including any objective design standards and reasonable spacing requirements for ground-based equipment, for 30 days after the date of the request. At the conclusion of the negotiation period, if the alternative location is accepted by the applicant, the applicant must notify the authority of such acceptance and the application shall be deemed granted for any new location for which there is agreement and all other locations in the application. If an agreement is not reached, the applicant must notify the authority of such nonagreement and the authority must grant or deny the original application within 90 days after the date the application was filed. A request for an alternative location, an acceptance of an alternative location, or a rejection of an alternative location must be in writing and provided by electronic mail.5. An authority shall limit the height of a small wireless facility to 10 feet above the utility pole or structure upon which the small wireless facility is to be collocated. Unless waived by an authority, the height for a new utility pole is limited to the tallest existing utility pole as of July 1, 2017, located in the same right-of-way, other than a utility pole for which a waiver has previously been granted, measured from grade in place within 500 feet of the proposed location of the small wireless facility. If there is no utility pole within 500 feet, the authority shall limit the height of the utility pole to 50 feet.6. The installation by a communications services provider of a utility pole in the public rights-of-way, other than a utility pole used to support a small wireless facility, is subject to authority rules or regulations governing the placement of utility poles in the public rights-of-way.7. Within 14 days after receiving an application, an authority must determine and notify the applicant by electronic mail as to whether the application is complete. If an application is deemed incomplete, the authority must specifically identify the missing information. An application is deemed complete if the authority fails to provide notification to the applicant within 14 days.8. An application must be processed on a nondiscriminatory basis. A complete application is deemed approved if an authority fails to approve or deny the application within 60 days after receipt of the application. If an authority does not use the 30-day negotiation period provided in subparagraph 4., the parties may mutually agree to extend the 60-day application review period. The authority shall grant or deny the application at the end of the extended period. A permit issued pursuant to an approved application shall remain effective for 1 year unless extended by the authority.9. An authority must notify the applicant of approval or denial by electronic mail. An authority shall approve a complete application unless it does not meet the authority’s applicable codes. If the application is denied, the authority must specify in writing the basis for denial, including the specific code provisions on which the denial was based, and send the documentation to the applicant by electronic mail on the day the authority denies the application. The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the authority and resubmit the application within 30 days after notice of the denial is sent to the applicant. The authority shall approve or deny the revised application within 30 days after receipt or the application is deemed approved. The review of a revised application is limited to the deficiencies cited in the denial. If an authority provides for administrative review of the denial of an application, the review must be complete and a written decision issued within 45 days after a written request for review is made. A denial must identify the specific code provisions on which the denial is based. If the administrative review is not complete within 45 days, the authority waives any claim regarding failure to exhaust administrative remedies in any judicial review of the denial of an application.10. An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of a single authority may, at the applicant’s discretion, file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for the collocation of up to 30 small wireless facilities. If the application includes multiple small wireless facilities, an authority may separately address small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete information has been received or which are denied.11. An authority may deny an application to collocate a small wireless facility or place a utility pole used to support a small wireless facility in the public rights-of-way if the proposed small wireless facility or utility pole used to support a small wireless facility:a. Materially interferes with the safe operation of traffic control equipment.b. Materially interferes with sight lines or clear zones for transportation, pedestrians, or public safety purposes.c. Materially interferes with compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act or similar federal or state standards regarding pedestrian access or movement.d. Materially fails to comply with the 2017 edition of the Florida Department of Transportation Utility Accommodation Manual.e. Fails to comply with applicable codes.f. Fails to comply with objective design standards authorized under paragraph (r).12. An authority may adopt by ordinance provisions for insurance coverage, indemnification, force majeure, abandonment, authority liability, or authority warranties. Such provisions must be reasonable and nondiscriminatory. An authority may require a construction bond to secure restoration of the postconstruction rights-of-way to the preconstruction condition. However, such bond must be time-limited to not more than 18 months after the construction to which the bond applies is completed. For any financial obligation required by an authority allowed under this section, the authority shall accept a letter of credit or similar financial instrument issued by any financial institution that is authorized to do business within the United States, provided that a claim against the financial instrument may be made by electronic means, including by facsimile. A provider of communications services may add an authority to any existing bond, insurance policy, or other relevant financial instrument, and the authority must accept such proof of coverage without any conditions other than consent to venue for purposes of any litigation to which the authority is a party. An authority may not require a communications services provider to indemnify it for liabilities not caused by the provider, including liabilities arising from the authority’s negligence, gross negligence, or willful conduct.13. Collocation of a small wireless facility on an authority utility pole does not provide the basis for the imposition of an ad valorem tax on the authority utility pole.14. An authority may reserve space on authority utility poles for future public safety uses. However, a reservation of space may not preclude collocation of a small wireless facility. If replacement of the authority utility pole is necessary to accommodate the collocation of the small wireless facility and the future public safety use, the pole replacement is subject to make-ready provisions and the replaced pole shall accommodate the future public safety use.15. A structure granted a permit and installed pursuant to this subsection shall comply with chapter 333 and federal regulations pertaining to airport airspace protections.

(e) An authority may not require any permit or other approval or require fees or other charges, costs, or other exactions for:1. Routine maintenance, the performance of service restoration work on existing facilities, or repair work, including, but not limited to, emergency repairs of existing facilities or extensions of such facilities for providing communications services to customers;2. Replacement of existing wireless facilities with wireless facilities that are substantially similar or of the same or smaller size; or3. Installation, placement, maintenance, or replacement of micro wireless facilities that are suspended on cables strung between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable codes by or for a communications services provider authorized to occupy the rights-of-way and who is remitting taxes under chapter 202. An authority may require an initial letter from or on behalf of such provider, which is effective upon filing, attesting that the micro wireless facility dimensions comply with the limits of this subsection. The authority may not require any additional filing or other information as long as the provider is deploying the same, a substantially similar, or a smaller size micro wireless facility equipment.Notwithstanding this paragraph, an authority may require a right-of-way permit for work that involves excavation, closure of a sidewalk, or closure of a vehicular lane or parking lane, unless the provider is performing service restoration on an existing facility and the work is done in compliance with the 2017 edition of the Florida Department of Transportation Utility Accommodation Manual. An authority may require notice of such work within 30 days after restoration and may require an after-the-fact permit for work which would otherwise have required a permit.

(f) Collocation of small wireless facilities on authority utility poles is subject to the following requirements:1. An authority may not enter into an exclusive arrangement with any person for the right to attach equipment to authority utility poles.2. The rates and fees for collocations on authority utility poles must be nondiscriminatory, regardless of the services provided by the collocating person.3. The rate to collocate small wireless facilities on an authority utility pole may not exceed $150 per pole annually.4. Agreements between authorities and wireless providers that are in effect on July 1, 2017, and that relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small wireless facilities on authority utility poles, remain in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions. The wireless provider may accept the rates, fees, and terms established under this subsection for small wireless facilities and utility poles that are the subject of an application submitted after the rates, fees, and terms become effective.5. A person owning or controlling an authority utility pole shall offer rates, fees, and other terms that comply with this subsection. By the later of January 1, 2018, or 3 months after receiving a request to collocate its first small wireless facility on a utility pole owned or controlled by an authority, the person owning or controlling the authority utility pole shall make available, through ordinance or otherwise, rates, fees, and terms for the collocation of small wireless facilities on the authority utility pole which comply with this subsection.a. The rates, fees, and terms must be nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral and must comply with this subsection.b. For an authority utility pole that supports an aerial facility used to provide communications services or electric service, the parties shall comply with the process for make-ready work under 47 U.S.C. s. 224 and implementing regulations. The good faith estimate of the person owning or controlling the pole for any make-ready work necessary to enable the pole to support the requested collocation must include pole replacement if necessary.c. For an authority utility pole that does not support an aerial facility used to provide communications services or electric service, the authority shall provide a good faith estimate for any make-ready work necessary to enable the pole to support the requested collocation, including necessary pole replacement, within 60 days after receipt of a complete application. Make-ready work, including any pole replacement, must be completed within 60 days after written acceptance of the good faith estimate by the applicant. Alternatively, an authority may require the applicant seeking to collocate a small wireless facility to provide a make-ready estimate at the applicant’s expense for the work necessary to support the small wireless facility, including pole replacement, and perform the make-ready work. If pole replacement is required, the scope of the make-ready estimate is limited to the design, fabrication, and installation of a utility pole that is substantially similar in color and composition. The authority may not condition or restrict the manner in which the applicant obtains, develops, or provides the estimate or conducts the make-ready work subject to usual construction restoration standards for work in the right-of-way. The replaced or altered utility pole shall remain the property of the authority.d. An authority may not require more make-ready work than is required to meet applicable codes or industry standards. Fees for make-ready work may not include costs related to preexisting damage or prior noncompliance. Fees for make-ready work, including any pole replacement, may not exceed actual costs or the amount charged to communications services providers other than wireless services providers for similar work and may not include any consultant fee or expense.

(g) For any applications filed before the effective date of ordinances implementing this subsection, an authority may apply current ordinances relating to placement of communications facilities in the right-of-way related to registration, permitting, insurance coverage, indemnification, force majeure, abandonment, authority liability, or authority warranties. Permit application requirements and small wireless facility placement requirements, including utility pole height limits, that conflict with this subsection must be waived by the authority. An authority may not institute, either expressly or de facto, a moratorium, zoning-in-progress, or other mechanism that would prohibit or delay the filing, receiving, or processing of registrations, applications, or issuing of permits or other approvals for the collocation of small wireless facilities or the installation, modification, or replacement of utility poles used to support the collocation of small wireless facilities.

(h) Except as provided in this section or specifically required by state law, an authority may not adopt or enforce any regulation on the placement or operation of communications facilities in the rights-of-way by a provider authorized by state law to operate in the rights-of-way and may not regulate any communications services or impose or collect any tax, fee, or charge not specifically authorized under state law. This paragraph does not alter any law regarding an authority’s ability to regulate the relocation of facilities.

(i)1. In an area where an authority has required all public utility lines in the rights-of-way to be placed underground, a wireless provider must comply with written, objective, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory requirements that prohibit new utility poles used to support small wireless facilities if:a. The authority, at least 90 days prior to the submission of an application, has required all public utility lines to be placed underground;b. Structures that the authority allows to remain above ground are reasonably available to wireless providers for the collocation of small wireless facilities and may be replaced by a wireless provider to accommodate the collocation of small wireless facilities; andc. A wireless provider may install a new utility pole in the designated area in the right-of-way that otherwise complies with this subsection and it is not reasonably able to provide wireless service by collocating on a remaining utility pole or other structure in the right-of-way.2. For small wireless facilities installed before an authority adopts requirements that public utility lines be placed underground, an authority adopting such requirements must:a. Allow a wireless provider to maintain the small wireless facilities in place subject to any applicable pole attachment agreement with the pole owner; orb. Allow the wireless provider to replace the associated pole within 50 feet of the prior location in accordance with paragraph (r).

(j) A wireless infrastructure provider may apply to an authority to place utility poles in the public rights-of-way to support the collocation of small wireless facilities. The application must include an attestation that small wireless facilities will be collocated on the utility pole or structure and will be used by a wireless services provider to provide service within 9 months after the date the application is approved. The authority shall accept and process the application in accordance with subparagraph (d)6. and any applicable codes and other local codes governing the placement of utility poles in the public rights-of-way.

(k) This subsection does not limit a local government’s authority to enforce historic preservation zoning regulations consistent with the preservation of local zoning authority under 47 U.S.C. s. 332(c)(7), the requirements for facility modifications under 47 U.S.C. s. 1455(a), or the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and the regulations adopted to implement such laws. An authority may enforce local codes, administrative rules, or regulations adopted by ordinance in effect on April 1, 2017, which are applicable to a historic area designated by the state or authority. An authority may enforce pending local ordinances, administrative rules, or regulations applicable to a historic area designated by the state if the intent to adopt such changes has been publicly declared on or before April 1, 2017. An authority may waive any ordinances or other requirements that are subject to this paragraph.

(l) This subsection does not authorize a person to collocate or attach wireless facilities, including any antenna, micro wireless facility, or small wireless facility, on a privately owned utility pole, a utility pole owned by an electric cooperative or a municipal electric utility, a privately owned wireless support structure, or other private property without the consent of the property owner.

(m) The approval of the installation, placement, maintenance, or operation of a small wireless facility pursuant to this subsection does not authorize the provision of any voice, data, or video communications services or the installation, placement, maintenance, or operation of any communications facilities other than small wireless facilities in the right-of-way.

(n) This subsection does not affect provisions relating to pass-through providers in subsection (6).

(o) This subsection does not authorize a person to collocate or attach small wireless facilities or micro wireless facilities on a utility pole, unless otherwise permitted by federal law, or erect a wireless support structure in the right-of-way located within a retirement community that:1. Is deed restricted as housing for older persons as defined in s. 760.29(4)(b);2. Has more than 5,000 residents; and3. Has underground utilities for electric transmission or distribution.This paragraph does not apply to the installation, placement, maintenance, or replacement of micro wireless facilities on any existing and duly authorized aerial communications facilities, provided that once aerial facilities are converted to underground facilities, any such collocation or construction shall be only as provided by the municipality’s underground utilities ordinance.

(p) This subsection does not authorize a person to collocate or attach small wireless facilities or micro wireless facilities on a utility pole, unless otherwise permitted by federal law, or erect a wireless support structure in the right-of-way located within a municipality that:1. Is located on a coastal barrier island as defined in s. 161.053(1)(b)3.;2. Has a land area of less than 5 square miles;3. Has fewer than 10,000 residents; and4. Has, before July 1, 2017, received referendum approval to issue debt to finance municipal-wide undergrounding of its utilities for electric transmission or distribution.This paragraph does not apply to the installation, placement, maintenance, or replacement of micro wireless facilities on any existing and duly authorized aerial communications facilities, provided that once aerial facilities are converted to underground facilities, any such collocation or construction shall be only as provided by the municipality’s underground utilities ordinance.

"(a)1. An M.P.O. shall be designated for each urbanized area of the state; however, this does not require that an individual M.P.O. be designated for each such area. Such designation shall be accomplished by agreement between the Governor and units of general-purpose local government representing at least 75 percent of the population of the urbanized area; however, the unit of general-purpose local government that represents the central city or cities within the M.P.O. jurisdiction, as defined by the United States Bureau of the Census, must be a party to such agreement.2. To the extent possible, only one M.P.O. shall be designated for each urbanized area or group of contiguous urbanized areas. More than one M.P.O. may be designated within an existing urbanized area only if the Governor and the existing M.P.O. determine that the size and complexity of the existing urbanized area makes the designation of more than one M.P.O. for the area appropriate, in which case each M.P.O. designated for the area must:a. Consult with every other M.P.O. designated for the urbanized area and the state to coordinate plans and transportation improvement programs.b. Ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, the consistency of data used in the planning process, including data used in forecasting travel demand within the urbanized area.

(b) Each M.P.O. designated in a manner prescribed by Title 23 of the United States Code shall be created and operated under the provisions of this section pursuant to an interlocal agreement entered into pursuant to s. 163.01. The signatories to the interlocal agreement shall be the department and the governmental entities designated by the Governor for membership on the M.P.O. Each M.P.O. shall be considered separate from the state or the governing body of a local government that is represented on the governing board of the M.P.O. or that is a signatory to the interlocal agreement creating the M.P.O. and shall have such powers and privileges that are provided under s. 163.01. If there is a conflict between this section and s. 163.01, this section prevails.

(c) The jurisdictional boundaries of an M.P.O. shall be determined by agreement between the Governor and the applicable M.P.O. The boundaries must include at least the metropolitan planning area, which is the existing urbanized area and the contiguous area expected to become urbanized within a 20-year forecast period, and may encompass the entire metropolitan statistical area or the consolidated metropolitan statistical area.

(d) In the case of an urbanized area designated as a nonattainment area for ozone or carbon monoxide under the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. ss. 7401 et seq., the boundaries of the metropolitan planning area in existence as of the date of enactment of this paragraph shall be retained, except that the boundaries may be adjusted by agreement of the Governor and affected metropolitan planning organizations in the manner described in this section. If more than one M.P.O. has authority within a metropolitan area or an area that is designated as a nonattainment area, each M.P.O. shall consult with other M.P.O.’s designated for such area and with the state in the coordination of plans and programs required by this section.

(e) The governing body of the M.P.O. shall designate, at a minimum, a chair, vice chair, and agency clerk. The chair and vice chair shall be selected from among the member delegates comprising the governing board. The agency clerk shall be charged with the responsibility of preparing meeting minutes and maintaining agency records. The clerk shall be a member of the M.P.O. governing board, an employee of the M.P.O., or other natural person.

(a) The voting membership of an M.P.O. shall consist of at least 5 but not more than 25 apportioned members, with the exact number determined on an equitable geographic-population ratio basis, based on an agreement among the affected units of general-purpose local government and the Governor, as required by federal regulations. In accordance with 23 U.S.C. s. 134, the Governor may also allow M.P.O. members who represent municipalities to alternate with representatives from other municipalities within the metropolitan planning area which do not have members on the M.P.O. With the exception of instances in which all of the county commissioners in a single-county M.P.O. are members of the M.P.O. governing board, county commissioners shall compose at least one-third of the M.P.O. governing board membership. A multicounty M.P.O. may satisfy this requirement by any combination of county commissioners from each of the counties constituting the M.P.O. Voting members shall be elected officials of general-purpose local governments, one of whom may represent a group of general-purpose local governments through an entity created by an M.P.O. for that purpose. An M.P.O. may include, as part of its apportioned voting members, a member of a statutorily authorized planning board, an official of an agency that operates or administers a major mode of transportation, or an official of Space Florida. As used in this section, the term “elected officials of a general-purpose local government” excludes constitutional officers, including sheriffs, tax collectors, supervisors of elections, property appraisers, clerks of the court, and similar types of officials. County commissioners shall compose not less than 20 percent of the M.P.O. membership if an official of an agency that operates or administers a major mode of transportation has been appointed to an M.P.O.

(b) In metropolitan areas in which authorities or other agencies have been or may be created by law to perform transportation functions and are or will be performing transportation functions that are not under the jurisdiction of a general-purpose local government represented on the M.P.O., such authorities or other agencies may be provided voting membership on the M.P.O. In all other M.P.O.’s in which transportation authorities or agencies are to be represented by elected officials from general-purpose local governments, the M.P.O. shall establish a process by which the collective interests of such authorities or other agencies are expressed and conveyed.

(c) Any other provision of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, a chartered county with over 1 million population may elect to reapportion the membership of an M.P.O. whose jurisdiction is wholly within the county. The charter county may exercise the provisions of this paragraph if:1. The M.P.O. approves the reapportionment plan by a three-fourths vote of its membership;2. The M.P.O. and the charter county determine that the reapportionment plan is needed to fulfill specific goals and policies applicable to that metropolitan planning area; and3. The charter county determines the reapportionment plan otherwise complies with all federal requirements pertaining to M.P.O. membership.Any charter county that elects to exercise the provisions of this paragraph shall notify the Governor in writing.

(d) Any other provision of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, any county as defined in s. 125.011(1) may elect to have its county commission serve as the M.P.O., if the M.P.O. jurisdiction is wholly contained within the county. Any charter county that elects to exercise the provisions of this paragraph shall so notify the Governor in writing. Upon receipt of such notification, the Governor must designate the county commission as the M.P.O. The Governor must appoint four additional voting members to the M.P.O., one of whom must be an elected official representing a municipality within the county, one of whom must be an expressway authority member, one of whom must be a person who does not hold elected public office and who resides in the unincorporated portion of the county, and one of whom must be a school board member.

(a) Each M.P.O. shall review the composition of its membership in conjunction with the decennial census, as prepared by the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, and with the agreement of the Governor and the affected general-purpose local government units that constitute the existing M.P.O., reapportion the membership as necessary to comply with subsection (3). At the request of a majority of the affected units of general-purpose local government comprising an M.P.O., the Governor and a majority of units of general-purpose local government serving on an M.P.O. shall cooperatively agree upon and prescribe who may serve as an alternate member and a method for appointing alternate members, who may vote at any M.P.O. meeting that he or she attends in place of a regular member. The method must be set forth as a part of the interlocal agreement describing the M.P.O. membership or in the operating procedures and bylaws of the M.P.O. The governmental entity so designated shall appoint the appropriate number of members to the M.P.O. from eligible officials. Representatives of the department shall serve as nonvoting advisers to the M.P.O. governing board. Additional nonvoting advisers may be appointed by the M.P.O. as deemed necessary; however, to the maximum extent feasible, each M.P.O. shall seek to appoint nonvoting representatives of various multimodal forms of transportation not otherwise represented by voting members of the M.P.O. An M.P.O. shall appoint nonvoting advisers representing major military installations located within the jurisdictional boundaries of the M.P.O. upon the request of the aforesaid major military installations and subject to the agreement of the M.P.O. All nonvoting advisers may attend and participate fully in governing board meetings but may not vote or be members of the governing board.

(b) Except for members who represent municipalities on the basis of alternating with representatives from other municipalities that do not have members on the M.P.O. as provided in paragraph (3)(a), the members of an M.P.O. shall serve 4-year terms. Members who represent municipalities on the basis of alternating with representatives from other municipalities that do not have members on the M.P.O. as provided in paragraph (3)(a) may serve terms of up to 4 years as further provided in the interlocal agreement described in paragraph (2)(b). The membership of a member who is a public official automatically terminates upon the member’s leaving his or her elective or appointive office for any reason, or may be terminated by a majority vote of the total membership of the entity’s governing board represented by the member. A vacancy shall be filled by the original appointing entity. A member may be reappointed for one or more additional 4-year terms.

(c) If a governmental entity fails to fill an assigned appointment to an M.P.O. within 60 days after notification by the Governor of its duty to appoint, that appointment shall be made by the Governor from the eligible representatives of that governmental entity.

(a) Each M.P.O. shall, in cooperation with the department, develop:1. A long-range transportation plan pursuant to the requirements of subsection (7).2. An annually updated transportation improvement program pursuant to the requirements of subsection (8).3. An annual unified planning work program pursuant to the requirements of subsection (9).

(b) In developing the long-range transportation plan and the transportation improvement program required under paragraph (a), each M.P.O. shall provide for consideration of projects and strategies that will:1. Support the economic vitality of the contiguous urbanized metropolitan area, especially by enabling global competitiveness, productivity, and efficiency.2. Increase the safety and security of the transportation system for motorized and nonmotorized users.3. Increase the accessibility and mobility options available to people and for freight.4. Protect and enhance the environment, promote energy conservation, and improve quality of life.5. Enhance the integration and connectivity of the transportation system, across and between modes and contiguous urbanized metropolitan areas, for people and freight.6. Promote efficient system management and operation.7. Emphasize the preservation of the existing transportation system.8. Improve the resilience of transportation infrastructure.

(c) In order to provide recommendations to the department and local governmental entities regarding transportation plans and programs, each M.P.O. shall:1. Prepare a congestion management system for the contiguous urbanized metropolitan area and cooperate with the department in the development of all other transportation management systems required by state or federal law.2. Assist the department in mapping transportation planning boundaries required by state or federal law.3. Assist the department in performing its duties relating to access management, functional classification of roads, and data collection.4. Execute all agreements or certifications necessary to comply with applicable state or federal law.5. Represent all the jurisdictional areas within the metropolitan area in the formulation of transportation plans and programs required by this section.6. Perform all other duties required by state or federal law.

(d) Each M.P.O. shall appoint a technical advisory committee, the members of which shall serve at the pleasure of the M.P.O. The membership of the technical advisory committee must include, whenever possible, planners; engineers; representatives of local aviation authorities, intermodal logistics centers, port authorities, and public transit authorities or representatives of aviation departments, seaport departments, and public transit departments of municipal or county governments, as applicable; the school superintendent of each county within the jurisdiction of the M.P.O. or the superintendent’s designee; and other appropriate representatives of affected local governments. For each M.P.O. the voting membership of which is governed by paragraph (3)(a), when selecting the membership of the technical advisory committee, the M.P.O. must consider the proportional representation of the area’s population. In addition to any other duties assigned to it by the M.P.O. or by state or federal law, the technical advisory committee is responsible for considering safe access to schools in its review of transportation project priorities, long-range transportation plans, and transportation improvement programs, and shall advise the M.P.O. on such matters. In addition, the technical advisory committee shall coordinate its actions with local school boards and other local programs and organizations within the metropolitan area which participate in school safety activities, such as locally established community traffic safety teams. Local school boards must provide the appropriate M.P.O. with information concerning future school sites and in the coordination of transportation service.

(e)1. Each M.P.O. shall appoint a citizens’ advisory committee, the members of which serve at the pleasure of the M.P.O. The membership on the citizens’ advisory committee must reflect a broad cross-section of local residents with an interest in the development of an efficient, safe, and cost-effective transportation system. Minorities, the elderly, and the handicapped must be adequately represented.2. Notwithstanding subparagraph 1., an M.P.O. may, with the approval of the department and the applicable federal governmental agency, adopt an alternative program or mechanism to ensure citizen involvement in the transportation planning process.

(f) The department shall allocate to each M.P.O., for the purpose of accomplishing its transportation planning and programming duties, an appropriate amount of federal transportation planning funds.

(g) Each M.P.O. shall have an executive or staff director who reports directly to the M.P.O. governing board for all matters regarding the administration and operation of the M.P.O. and any additional personnel as deemed necessary. The executive director and any additional personnel may be employed either by an M.P.O. or by another governmental entity, such as a county, city, or regional planning council, that has a staff services agreement signed and in effect with the M.P.O. Each M.P.O. may enter into contracts with local or state agencies, private planning firms, private engineering firms, or other public or private entities to accomplish its transportation planning and programming duties and administrative functions.

(h) In order to enhance their knowledge, effectiveness, and participation in the urbanized area transportation planning process, each M.P.O. shall provide training opportunities and training funds specifically for local elected officials and others who serve on an M.P.O. The training opportunities may be conducted by an individual M.P.O. or through statewide and federal training programs and initiatives that are specifically designed to meet the needs of M.P.O. board members.

(i) By December 31, 2023, the M.P.O.’s serving Hillsborough, Pasco, and Pinellas Counties must submit a feasibility report to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives exploring the benefits, costs, and process of consolidation into a single M.P.O. serving the contiguous urbanized area, the goal of which 1would be to:1. Coordinate transportation projects deemed to be regionally significant.2. Review the impact of regionally significant land use decisions on the region.3. Review all proposed regionally significant transportation projects in the transportation improvement programs.

(j)1. To more fully accomplish the purposes for which M.P.O.’s have been mandated, M.P.O.’s shall develop coordination mechanisms with one another to expand and improve transportation within the state. The appropriate method of coordination between M.P.O.’s shall vary depending upon the project involved and given local and regional needs. Consequently, it is appropriate to set forth a flexible methodology that can be used by M.P.O.’s to coordinate with other M.P.O.’s and appropriate political subdivisions as circumstances demand.2. Any M.P.O. may join with any other M.P.O. or any individual political subdivision to coordinate activities or to achieve any federal or state transportation planning or development goals or purposes consistent with federal or state law. When an M.P.O. determines that it is appropriate to join with another M.P.O. or any political subdivision to coordinate activities, the M.P.O. or political subdivision shall enter into an interlocal agreement pursuant to s. 163.01, which, at a minimum, creates a separate legal or administrative entity to coordinate the transportation planning or development activities required to achieve the goal or purpose; provides the purpose for which the entity is created; provides the duration of the agreement and the entity and specifies how the agreement may be terminated, modified, or rescinded; describes the precise organization of the entity, including who has voting rights on the governing board, whether alternative voting members are provided for, how voting members are appointed, and what the relative voting strength is for each constituent M.P.O. or political subdivision; provides the manner in which the parties to the agreement will provide for the financial support of the entity and payment of costs and expenses of the entity; provides the manner in which funds may be paid to and disbursed from the entity; and provides how members of the entity will resolve disagreements regarding interpretation of the interlocal agreement or disputes relating to the operation of the entity. Such interlocal agreement shall become effective upon its recordation in the official public records of each county in which a member of the entity created by the interlocal agreement has a voting member. Multiple M.P.O.’s may merge, combine, or otherwise join together as a single M.P.O.

(a) Identify transportation facilities, including, but not limited to, major roadways, airports, seaports, spaceports, commuter rail systems, transit systems, and intermodal or multimodal terminals that will function as an integrated metropolitan transportation system. The long-range transportation plan must give emphasis to those transportation facilities that serve national, statewide, or regional functions, and must consider the goals and objectives identified in the Florida Transportation Plan as provided in s. 339.155. If a project is located within the boundaries of more than one M.P.O., the M.P.O.’s must coordinate plans regarding the project in the long-range transportation plan. Multiple M.P.O.’s within a contiguous urbanized area must coordinate the development of long-range transportation plans to be reviewed by the Metropolitan Planning Organization Advisory Council.

(b) Include a financial plan that demonstrates how the plan can be implemented, indicating resources from public and private sources which are reasonably expected to be available to carry out the plan, and recommends any additional financing strategies for needed projects and programs. The financial plan may include, for illustrative purposes, additional projects that would be included in the adopted long-range transportation plan if reasonable additional resources beyond those identified in the financial plan were available. For the purpose of developing the long-range transportation plan, the M.P.O. and the department shall cooperatively develop estimates of funds that will be available to support the plan implementation. Innovative financing techniques may be used to fund needed projects and programs. Such techniques may include the assessment of tolls, the use of value capture financing, or the use of value pricing. Multiple M.P.O.’s within a contiguous urbanized area must ensure, to the maximum extent possible, the consistency of data used in the planning process.

(c) Assess capital investment and other measures necessary to:1. Ensure the preservation of the existing metropolitan transportation system including requirements for the operation, resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation of major roadways and requirements for the operation, maintenance, modernization, and rehabilitation of public transportation facilities; and2. Make the most efficient use of existing transportation facilities to relieve vehicular congestion, improve safety, and maximize the mobility of people and goods. Such efforts must include, but are not limited to, consideration of infrastructure and technological improvements necessary to accommodate advances in vehicle technology, such as automated driving systems and other developments.

(d) Indicate, as appropriate, proposed transportation enhancement activities, including, but not limited to, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, trails or facilities that are regionally significant or critical linkages for the Florida Shared-Use Nonmotorized Trail Network, scenic easements, landscaping, historic preservation, mitigation of water pollution due to highway runoff, and control of outdoor advertising.

(e) In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (a)-(d), in metropolitan areas that are classified as nonattainment areas for ozone or carbon monoxide, the M.P.O. must coordinate the development of the long-range transportation plan with the State Implementation Plan developed pursuant to the requirements of the federal Clean Air Act.

(a) Each M.P.O. is responsible for developing, annually, a list of project priorities and a transportation improvement program. The prevailing principles to be considered by each M.P.O. when developing a list of project priorities and a transportation improvement program are: preserving the existing transportation infrastructure; enhancing Florida’s economic competitiveness; and improving travel choices to ensure safety and mobility. The transportation improvement program will be used to initiate federally aided transportation facilities and improvements as well as other transportation facilities and improvements including transit, rail, aviation, spaceport, and port facilities to be funded from the State Transportation Trust Fund within its metropolitan area in accordance with existing and subsequent federal and state laws and rules and regulations related thereto. The transportation improvement program shall be consistent, to the maximum extent feasible, with the approved local government comprehensive plans of the units of local government whose boundaries are within the metropolitan area of the M.P.O. and include those projects programmed pursuant to s. 339.2819(4). Multiple M.P.O.’s within a contiguous urbanized area must coordinate transportation improvement programs.

(b) Each M.P.O. annually shall prepare a list of project priorities and shall submit the list to the appropriate district of the department by August 1 of each year; however, the department and a metropolitan planning organization may, in writing, agree to vary this submittal date. Where more than one M.P.O. exists in an urbanized area, the M.P.O.’s shall coordinate in the development of regionally significant project priorities. The list of project priorities must be formally reviewed by the technical and citizens’ advisory committees, and approved by the M.P.O., before it is transmitted to the district. The approved list of project priorities must be used by the district in developing the district work program and must be used by the M.P.O. in developing its transportation improvement program. The annual list of project priorities must be based upon project selection criteria that, at a minimum, consider the following:1. The approved M.P.O. long-range transportation plan;2. The Strategic Intermodal System Plan developed under s. 339.64.3. The priorities developed pursuant to s. 339.2819(4).4. The results of the transportation management systems; and5. The M.P.O.’s public-involvement procedures.

(c) The transportation improvement program must, at a minimum:1. Include projects and project phases to be funded with state or federal funds within the time period of the transportation improvement program and which are recommended for advancement during the next fiscal year and 4 subsequent fiscal years. Such projects and project phases must be consistent, to the maximum extent feasible, with the approved local government comprehensive plans of the units of local government located within the jurisdiction of the M.P.O. For informational purposes, the transportation improvement program shall also include a list of projects to be funded from local or private revenues.2. Include projects within the metropolitan area which are proposed for funding under 23 U.S.C. s. 134 of the Federal Transit Act and which are consistent with the long-range transportation plan developed under subsection (7).3. Provide a financial plan that demonstrates how the transportation improvement program can be implemented; indicates the resources, both public and private, that are reasonably expected to be available to accomplish the program; identifies any innovative financing techniques that may be used to fund needed projects and programs; and may include, for illustrative purposes, additional projects that would be included in the approved transportation improvement program if reasonable additional resources beyond those identified in the financial plan were available. Innovative financing techniques may include the assessment of tolls, the use of value capture financing, or the use of value pricing. The transportation improvement program may include a project or project phase only if full funding can reasonably be anticipated to be available for the project or project phase within the time period contemplated for completion of the project or project phase.4. Group projects and project phases of similar urgency and anticipated staging into appropriate staging periods.5. Indicate how the transportation improvement program relates to the long-range transportation plan developed under subsection (7), including providing examples of specific projects or project phases that further the goals and policies of the long-range transportation plan.6. Indicate whether any project or project phase is inconsistent with an approved comprehensive plan of a unit of local government located within the jurisdiction of the M.P.O. If a project is inconsistent with an affected comprehensive plan, the M.P.O. must provide justification for including the project in the transportation improvement program.7. Indicate how the improvements are consistent, to the maximum extent feasible, with affected seaport, airport, and spaceport master plans and with public transit development plans of the units of local government located within the jurisdiction of the M.P.O. If a project is located within the boundaries of more than one M.P.O., the M.P.O.’s must coordinate plans regarding the project in the transportation improvement program.8. Indicate coordination or alignment with transportation improvement plans of other M.P.O.’s within the contiguous urbanized area.

(d) Projects included in the transportation improvement program and that have advanced to the design stage of preliminary engineering may be removed from or rescheduled in a subsequent transportation improvement program only by the joint action of the M.P.O. and the department. Except when recommended in writing by the district secretary for good cause, any project removed from or rescheduled in a subsequent transportation improvement program shall not be rescheduled by the M.P.O. in that subsequent program earlier than the 5th year of such program.

(e) During the development of the transportation improvement program, the M.P.O. shall, in cooperation with the department and any affected public transit operation, provide citizens, affected public agencies, representatives of transportation agency employees, freight shippers, providers of freight transportation services, private providers of transportation, representatives of users of public transit, and other interested parties with reasonable notice of and an opportunity to comment on the proposed program.

(f) The adopted annual transportation improvement program for M.P.O.’s in nonattainment or maintenance areas must be submitted to the district secretary and the Department of Commerce at least 90 days before the submission of the state transportation improvement program by the department to the appropriate federal agencies. The annual transportation improvement program for M.P.O.’s in attainment areas must be submitted to the district secretary and the Department of Commerce at least 45 days before the department submits the state transportation improvement program to the appropriate federal agencies; however, the department, the Department of Commerce, and a metropolitan planning organization may, in writing, agree to vary this submittal date. The Governor or the Governor’s designee shall review and approve each transportation improvement program and any amendments thereto.

(g) The Department of Commerce shall review the annual transportation improvement program of each M.P.O. for consistency with the approved local government comprehensive plans of the units of local government whose boundaries are within the metropolitan area of each M.P.O. and shall identify those projects that are inconsistent with such comprehensive plans. The Department of Commerce shall notify an M.P.O. of any transportation projects contained in its transportation improvement program which are inconsistent with the approved local government comprehensive plans of the units of local government whose boundaries are within the metropolitan area of the M.P.O.

"(1)(a) In the exercise of such jurisdiction, the commission shall have power to prescribe fair and reasonable rates and charges, classifications, standards of quality and measurements, including the ability to adopt construction standards that exceed the National Electrical Safety Code, for purposes of ensuring the reliable provision of service, and service rules and regulations to be observed by each public utility; to require repairs, improvements, additions, replacements, and extensions to the plant and equipment of any public utility when reasonably necessary to promote the convenience and welfare of the public and secure adequate service or facilities for those reasonably entitled thereto; to employ and fix the compensation for such examiners and technical, legal, and clerical employees as it deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter; and to adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 to implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter.

(b) If the commission authorizes a public utility to charge tiered rates based upon levels of usage and to vary its regular billing period, the utility may not charge a customer a higher rate because of an increase in usage attributable to an extension of the billing period; however, the regular meter reading date may not be advanced or postponed more than 5 days for routine operating reasons without prorating the billing for the period.

(c) Effective January 1, 2016, a utility may not charge or receive a deposit in excess of the following amounts:1. For an existing account, the total deposit may not exceed 2 months of average actual charges, calculated by adding the monthly charges from the 12-month period immediately before the date any change in the deposit amount is sought, dividing this total by 12, and multiplying the result by 2. If the account has less than 12 months of actual charges, the deposit shall be calculated by adding the available monthly charges, dividing this total by the number of months available, and multiplying the result by 2.2. For a new service request, the total deposit may not exceed 2 months of projected charges, calculated by adding the 12 months of projected charges, dividing this total by 12, and multiplying the result by 2. Once a new customer has had continuous service for a 12-month period, the amount of the deposit shall be recalculated using actual data. Any difference between the projected and actual amounts must be resolved by the customer paying any additional amount that may be billed by the utility or the utility returning any overcharge.

(d) If a utility has more than one rate for any customer class, it must notify each customer in that class of the available rates and explain how the rate is charged to the customer. If a customer contacts the utility seeking assistance in selecting the most advantageous rate, the utility must provide good faith assistance to the customer. The customer is responsible for charges for service provided under the selected rate.

(e) New tariffs and changes to an existing tariff, other than an administrative change that does not substantially change the meaning or operation of the tariff, must be approved by majority vote of the commission, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.

"(5)(a) A permit approved for the development of alternative water supplies shall be granted for a term of at least 20 years if there is sufficient data to provide reasonable assurance that the conditions for permit issuance will be met for the duration of the permit. However, if the permittee issues bonds for the construction of the project, upon request of the permittee before the expiration of the permit, the permit shall be extended for such additional time as is required for the retirement of bonds, not including any refunding or refinancing of such bonds, if the governing board determines that the use will continue to meet the conditions for the issuance of the permit. The permit is subject to compliance reports under subsection (4).

(b)1. A permit approved on or after July 1, 2013, for the development of alternative water supplies shall be granted for a term of at least 30 years if there is sufficient data to provide reasonable assurance that the conditions for permit issuance will be met for the duration of the permit. If, within 7 years after a permit is granted, the permittee issues bonds to finance the project, completes construction of the project, and requests an extension of the permit duration, the permit shall be extended to expire upon the retirement of such bonds or 30 years after the date that construction of the project is complete, whichever occurs later. However, a permit’s duration may not be extended by more than 7 years beyond the permit’s original expiration date.2. A permit issued under this paragraph is subject to compliance reports under subsection (4). If the permittee demonstrates that bonds issued to finance the project are outstanding, the quantity of alternative water allocated in the permit may not be reduced during a compliance report review unless a reduction is needed to address harm to water resources or to existing legal uses present when the permit was issued. A reduction required by an applicable water shortage order applies to a permit issued under this paragraph.3. A permit issued under this paragraph may not authorize the use of nonbrackish groundwater supplies or nonalternative water supplies.

(c) An entity that wishes to develop alternative water supplies may apply for a permit under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b).

(6)(a) The Legislature finds that the need for alternative water supply development projects to meet anticipated public water supply demands of the state is so important that it is essential to encourage participation in and contribution to these projects by private-rural-land owners who characteristically have relatively modest near-term water demands but substantially increasing demands after the 20-year planning period in s. 373.709. Therefore, where such landowners make extraordinary contributions of lands or construction funding to enable the expeditious implementation of such projects, water management districts and the department may grant permits for such projects for a period of up to 50 years to municipalities, counties, special districts, regional water supply authorities, multijurisdictional water supply entities, and publicly or privately owned utilities, with the exception of any publicly or privately owned utilities created for or by a private landowner after April 1, 2008, which have entered into an agreement with the private landowner for the purpose of more efficiently pursuing alternative public water supply development projects identified in a district’s regional water supply plan and meeting water demands of both the applicant and the landowner.

(b) A permit under paragraph (a) may be granted only for that period for which there is sufficient data to provide reasonable assurance that the conditions for permit issuance will be met. Such a permit shall require a compliance report by the permittee every 5 years during the term of the permit. The report shall contain sufficient data to maintain reasonable assurance that the conditions for permit issuance applicable at the time of district review of the compliance report are met. After review of this report, the governing board or the department may modify the permit to ensure that the use meets the conditions for issuance. This subsection does not limit the existing authority of the department or the governing board to modify or revoke a consumptive use permit.

"(a) That significant quantities of petroleum and petroleum products are being stored in storage systems in this state, which is a hazardous undertaking.

(b) That spills, leaks, and other discharges from such storage systems have occurred, are occurring, and will continue to occur and that such discharges pose a significant threat to the quality of the groundwaters and inland surface waters of this state.

(c) That, where contamination of the ground or surface water has occurred, remedial measures have often been delayed for long periods while determinations as to liability and the extent of liability are made and that such delays result in the continuation and intensification of the threat to the public health, safety, and welfare; in greater damage to water resources and the environment; and in significantly higher costs to contain and remove the contamination.

(d) That adequate financial resources must be readily available to provide for the expeditious supply of safe and reliable alternative sources of potable water to affected persons and to provide a means for investigation and cleanup of contamination sites without delay.

(e) That it is necessary to fulfill the intent and purposes of ss. 376.30-376.317 and determined to be in the best interest of, and necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the residents of this state, and therefore a paramount public purpose, to provide for the creation of a nonprofit public benefit corporation as an instrumentality of the state to assist in financing the functions provided in ss. 376.30-376.317 and to authorize the department to enter into one or more service contracts with such corporation for the purpose of financing services related to such functions and to make payments thereunder from the amount on deposit in the Inland Protection Trust Fund, subject to annual appropriation by the Legislature.

(f) That to achieve the purposes established in paragraph (e) and in order to facilitate the expeditious handling and rehabilitation of contamination sites and remedial measures with respect to contamination sites without delay, it is in the best interests of the residents of this state to authorize such corporation to issue evidences of indebtedness payable from amounts paid by the department under any such service contract entered into between the department and such corporation.

(g) That the Petroleum Restoration Program must be implemented in a manner that reduces costs and improves the efficiency of rehabilitation activities to reduce the significant backlog of contaminated sites eligible for state-funded rehabilitation and the corresponding threat to the public health, safety, and welfare; water resources; and the environment.

(h) That Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005, amending the Clean Water Act, and that the state enacted the Renewable Fuels Standard, to establish a renewable fuel standard requiring the use of ethanol as an oxygenate additive for gasoline and biodiesel as an additive for ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel. An unintended consequence of the inclusion of ethanol in gasoline and biodiesel in diesel fuel has been to cause, and potentially cause, significant corrosion and other damage to storage tanks, piping, and storage tank system components regulated under this chapter. The Legislature further finds that storage tanks, piping, and storage tank system components have been found by the department in its equipment approval process to meet compatibility standards; however, these standards may have subsequently changed due to the introduction of ethanol and biodiesel. The state enacted secondary containment requirements before the mandated introduction of ethanol into gasoline and biodiesel into ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel. Therefore, owners and operators of petroleum storage facilities in the state that complied with the state’s secondary containment requirements and installed approved equipment that may not have been evaluated for compatibility with ethanol and biodiesel, cross-contamination due to the storage of gasoline and diesel fuel, and the effects of condensation and minimal amounts of water in storage tanks are at a particular risk for having to repair or replace equipment or take other preventive measures in advance of the equipment’s expected useful life in order to prevent releases or discharges of pollutants.

(a) It is the intent of the Legislature to establish the Inland Protection Trust Fund to serve as a repository for funds which will enable the department to respond without delay to incidents of inland contamination, and damage or potential damage to storage tank systems caused by ethanol or biodiesel as described in subsection (15) which may result in such incidents, related to the storage of petroleum and petroleum products in order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare and to minimize environmental damage.

(b) It is the intent of the Legislature that the department implement rules and procedures to improve the efficiency and productivity of the Petroleum Restoration Program. The department is directed to implement rules and policies to eliminate and reduce duplication of site rehabilitation efforts, paperwork, and documentation, and micromanagement of site rehabilitation tasks. The department shall make efficiency and productivity a priority in the administration of the Petroleum Restoration Program and to this end, when necessary, shall use petroleum program contracted services to improve the efficiency and productivity of the program. Furthermore, when implementing rules and procedures to improve such efficiency and productivity, the department shall recognize and consider the potential value of utilizing contracted inspection and professional resources to efficiently and productively administer the program.

(c) It is the intent of the Legislature that rehabilitation of contamination sites be conducted with emphasis on first addressing the sites that pose the greatest threat to the public health, safety, and welfare; water resources; and the environment, within the availability of funds in the Inland Protection Trust Fund, recognizing that source removal, wherever it is technologically feasible and cost-effective, will significantly reduce contamination or eliminate the spread of contamination and will protect the public health, safety, and welfare; water resources; and the environment.

(d) The department is directed to adopt and implement uniform and standardized forms for site rehabilitation work and for the submittal of reports to ensure that information is submitted to the department in a concise, standardized uniform format seeking only information that is necessary.

(e) The department is directed to implement computerized and electronic filing capabilities and submittal of reports in order to expedite submittal of the information and elimination of delay in paperwork.

(f) The department is directed to establish guidelines for consideration and acceptance of new and innovative technologies for site rehabilitation work.

(a) Prompt investigation and assessment of contamination sites.

(b) Expeditious restoration or replacement of potable water supplies as provided in s. 376.30(3)(c)1.

(c) Rehabilitation of contamination sites, which shall consist of cleanup of affected soil, groundwater, and inland surface waters, using the most cost-effective alternative that is technologically feasible and reliable and that provides adequate protection of the public health, safety, and welfare, and water resources, and that minimizes environmental damage, pursuant to the site selection and cleanup criteria established by the department under subsection (5), except that this paragraph does not authorize the department to obligate funds for payment of costs which may be associated with, but are not integral to, site rehabilitation, such as the cost for retrofitting or replacing petroleum storage systems.

(d) Maintenance and monitoring of contamination sites.

(e) Inspection and supervision of activities described in this subsection.

(f) Payment of expenses incurred by the department in its efforts to obtain from responsible parties the payment or recovery of reasonable costs resulting from the activities described in this subsection.

(g) Payment of any other reasonable costs of administration, including those administrative costs incurred by the Department of Health in providing field and laboratory services, toxicological risk assessment, and other assistance to the department in the investigation of drinking water contamination complaints and costs associated with public information and education activities.

(h) Establishment and implementation of the compliance verification program as authorized in s. 376.303(1)(a), including contracting with local governments or state agencies to provide for the administration of such program through locally administered programs, to minimize the potential for further contamination sites.

(i) Funding of the provisions of ss. 376.305(6) and 376.3072.

(j) Activities related to removal and replacement of petroleum storage systems, if repair, replacement, or other preventive measures are authorized under subsection (15), or exclusive of costs of any tank, piping, dispensing unit, or related hardware, if soil removal is approved as a component of site rehabilitation and requires removal of the tank where remediation is conducted under this section, or if such activities were justified in an approved remedial action plan.

(k) Reasonable costs of restoring property as nearly as practicable to the conditions which existed before activities associated with contamination assessment or remedial action taken under s. 376.303(4).

(l) Repayment of loans to the fund.

(m) Expenditure of sums from the fund to cover ineligible sites or costs as set forth in subsection (13), if the department in its discretion deems it necessary to do so. In such cases, the department may seek recovery and reimbursement of costs in the same manner and pursuant to the same procedures established for recovery and reimbursement of sums otherwise owed to or expended from the fund.

(n) Payment of amounts payable under any service contract entered into by the department pursuant to s. 376.3075, subject to annual appropriation by the Legislature.

(o) Petroleum remediation pursuant to this section throughout a state fiscal year. The department shall establish a process to uniformly encumber appropriated funds throughout a state fiscal year and shall allow for emergencies and imminent threats to public health, safety, and welfare; water resources; and the environment, as provided in paragraph (5)(a). This paragraph does not apply to appropriations associated with the free product recovery initiative provided in paragraph (5)(c) or the advanced cleanup program provided in s. 376.30713.

(p) Enforcement of this section and ss. 376.30-376.317 by the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Department of Environmental Protection. The department shall disburse moneys to the commission for such purpose.

(q) Payments for program deductibles, copayments, and limited contamination assessment reports that otherwise would be paid by another state agency for state-funded petroleum contamination site rehabilitation.

(r) Payments for the repair or replacement of, or other preventive measures for, storage tanks, piping, or system components as provided in subsection (15). Such costs may include equipment, excavation, electrical work, and site restoration.

(a) The department shall adopt rules to establish priorities based upon a scoring system for state-conducted cleanup at petroleum contamination sites based upon factors that include, but need not be limited to:1. The degree to which the public health, safety, or welfare may be affected by exposure to the contamination;2. The size of the population or area affected by the contamination;3. The present and future uses of the affected aquifer or surface waters, with particular consideration as to the probability that the contamination is substantially affecting, or will migrate to and substantially affect, a known public or private source of potable water; and4. The effect of the contamination on water resources and the environment.Moneys in the fund shall then be obligated for activities described in paragraphs (4)(a)-(e) at individual sites pursuant to such established criteria. However, this paragraph does not restrict the department from modifying the priority status of a rehabilitation site where conditions warrant, taking into consideration the actual distance between the contamination site and groundwater or surface water receptors or other factors that affect the risk of exposure to petroleum products’ chemicals of concern. The department may use the effective date of a department final order granting eligibility pursuant to subsections (10) and (13) and ss. 376.305(6) and 376.3072 to establish a prioritization system within a particular priority scoring range.

(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to protect the health of all people under actual circumstances of exposure. The secretary shall establish criteria by rule for the purpose of determining, on a site-specific basis, the rehabilitation program tasks that comprise a site rehabilitation program and the level at which a rehabilitation program task and a site rehabilitation program are completed. In establishing the rule, the department shall incorporate, to the maximum extent feasible, risk-based corrective action principles to achieve protection of the public health, safety, and welfare; water resources; and the environment in a cost-effective manner as provided in this subsection. Criteria for determining what constitutes a rehabilitation program task or completion of site rehabilitation program tasks and site rehabilitation programs shall be based upon the factors set forth in paragraph (a) and the following additional factors:1. The current exposure and potential risk of exposure to humans and the environment including multiple pathways of exposure.2. The appropriate point of compliance with cleanup target levels for petroleum products’ chemicals of concern. The point of compliance shall be at the source of the petroleum contamination. However, the department may temporarily move the point of compliance to the boundary of the property, or to the edge of the plume when the plume is within the property boundary, while cleanup, including cleanup through natural attenuation processes in conjunction with appropriate monitoring, is proceeding. The department may also, pursuant to criteria provided for in this paragraph, temporarily extend the point of compliance beyond the property boundary with appropriate monitoring, if such extension is needed to facilitate natural attenuation or to address the current conditions of the plume, if the public health, safety, and welfare; water resources; and the environment are adequately protected. Temporary extension of the point of compliance beyond the property boundary, as provided in this subparagraph, must include notice to local governments and owners of any property into which the point of compliance is allowed to extend.3. The appropriate site-specific cleanup goal. The site-specific cleanup goal shall be that all petroleum contamination sites ultimately achieve the applicable cleanup target levels provided in this paragraph. However, the department may allow concentrations of the petroleum products’ chemicals of concern to temporarily exceed the applicable cleanup target levels while cleanup, including cleanup through natural attenuation processes in conjunction with appropriate monitoring, is proceeding, if the public health, safety, and welfare; water resources; and the environment are adequately protected.4. The appropriateness of using institutional or engineering controls. Site rehabilitation programs may include the use of institutional or engineering controls to eliminate the potential exposure to petroleum products’ chemicals of concern to humans or the environment. Use of such controls must have prior department approval, and institutional controls may not be acquired with moneys from the fund other than the costs associated with a professional land survey or a specific purpose survey, if such is needed, and costs associated with obtaining a title report and recording fees. When institutional or engineering controls are implemented to control exposure, the removal of such controls must have prior department approval and must be accompanied immediately by the resumption of active cleanup or other approved controls unless cleanup target levels pursuant to this paragraph have been achieved.5. The additive effects of the petroleum products’ chemicals of concern. The synergistic effects of petroleum products’ chemicals of concern must also be considered when the scientific data becomes available.6. Individual site characteristics which must include, but not be limited to, the current and projected use of the affected groundwater in the vicinity of the site, current and projected land uses of the area affected by the contamination, the exposed population, the degree and extent of contamination, the rate of contaminant migration, the apparent or potential rate of contaminant degradation through natural attenuation processes, the location of the plume, and the potential for further migration in relation to site property boundaries.7. Applicable state water quality standards.a. Cleanup target levels for petroleum products’ chemicals of concern found in groundwater shall be the applicable state water quality standards. Where such standards do not exist, the cleanup target levels for groundwater shall be based on the minimum criteria specified in department rule. The department shall consider the following, as appropriate, in establishing the applicable minimum criteria: calculations using a lifetime cancer risk level of 1.0E-6; a hazard index of 1 or less; the best achievable detection limit; the naturally occurring background concentration; or nuisance, organoleptic, and aesthetic considerations.b. Where surface waters are exposed to petroleum contaminated groundwater, the cleanup target levels for the petroleum products’ chemicals of concern shall be based on the surface water standards as established by department rule. The point of measuring compliance with the surface water standards shall be in the groundwater immediately adjacent to the surface water body.8. Whether deviation from state water quality standards or from established criteria is appropriate. The department may issue a “No Further Action Order” based upon the degree to which the desired cleanup target level is achievable and can be reasonably and cost-effectively implemented within available technologies or engineering and institutional control strategies. Where a state water quality standard is applicable, a deviation may not result in the application of cleanup target levels more stringent than the standard. In determining whether it is appropriate to establish alternate cleanup target levels at a site, the department may consider the effectiveness of source removal that has been completed at the site and the practical likelihood of the use of low yield or poor quality groundwater; the use of groundwater near marine surface water bodies; the current and projected use of the affected groundwater in the vicinity of the site; or the use of groundwater in the immediate vicinity of the storage tank area, where it has been demonstrated that the groundwater contamination is not migrating away from such localized source, if the public health, safety, and welfare; water resources; and the environment are adequately protected.9. Appropriate cleanup target levels for soils.a. In establishing soil cleanup target levels for human exposure to petroleum products’ chemicals of concern found in soils from the land surface to 2 feet below land surface, the department shall consider the following, as appropriate: calculations using a lifetime cancer risk level of 1.0E-6; a hazard index of 1 or less; the best achievable detection limit; or the naturally occurring background concentration.b. Leachability-based soil target levels shall be based on protection of the groundwater cleanup target levels or the alternate cleanup target levels for groundwater established pursuant to this paragraph, as appropriate. Source removal and other cost-effective alternatives that are technologically feasible shall be considered in achieving the leachability soil target levels established by the department. The leachability goals do not apply if the department determines, based upon individual site characteristics, that petroleum products’ chemicals of concern will not leach into the groundwater at levels which pose a threat to public health, safety, and welfare; water resources; or the environment.This paragraph does not restrict the department from temporarily postponing completion of any site rehabilitation program for which funds are being expended whenever such postponement is necessary in order to make funds available for rehabilitation of a contamination site with a higher priority status.

(c) The department shall require source removal, if warranted and cost-effective, at each site eligible for restoration funding from the fund.1. Funding for free product recovery may be provided in advance of the order established by the priority ranking system under paragraph (a) for site cleanup activities. However, a separate prioritization for free product recovery shall be established consistent with paragraph (a). No more than $5 million shall be encumbered from the fund in any fiscal year for free product recovery conducted in advance of the priority order under paragraph (a) established for site cleanup activities.2. Once free product removal and other source removal identified in this paragraph are completed at a site, and notwithstanding the order established by the priority ranking system under paragraph (a) for site cleanup activities, the department may reevaluate the site to determine the degree of active cleanup needed to continue site rehabilitation. Further, the department shall determine whether the reevaluated site qualifies for natural attenuation monitoring, long-term natural attenuation monitoring, or no further action. If additional site rehabilitation is necessary to reach no further action status, the site rehabilitation shall be conducted in the order established by the priority ranking system under paragraph (a). The department shall use natural attenuation monitoring strategies and, when cost-effective, transition sites eligible for restoration funding assistance to long-term natural attenuation monitoring where the plume is shrinking or stable and confined to the source property boundaries and the petroleum products’ chemicals of concern meet the natural attenuation default concentrations, as defined by department rule. If the plume migrates beyond the source property boundaries, natural attenuation monitoring may be conducted pursuant to department rule, or if the site no longer qualifies for natural attenuation monitoring, active remediation may be resumed. For long-term natural attenuation monitoring, if the petroleum products’ chemicals of concern increase or are not significantly reduced after 42 months of monitoring, or if the plume migrates beyond the property boundaries, active remediation shall be resumed as necessary. For sites undergoing active remediation, the department shall evaluate the cost of natural attenuation monitoring to ensure that site mobilizations are performed in a cost-effective manner. Sites that are not eligible for state restoration funding may transition to long-term natural attenuation monitoring using the criteria in this subparagraph. This subparagraph does not preclude a site from pursuing a “No Further Action” order with conditions.3. The department shall evaluate whether higher natural attenuation default concentrations for natural attenuation monitoring or long-term natural attenuation monitoring are cost-effective and would adequately protect the public health, safety, and welfare; water resources; and the environment. The department shall also evaluate site-specific characteristics that would allow for higher natural attenuation or long-term natural attenuation concentration levels.4. A local government may not deny a building permit based solely on the presence of petroleum contamination for any construction, repairs, or renovations performed in conjunction with tank upgrade activities to an existing retail fuel facility if the facility was fully operational before the building permit was requested and if the construction, repair, or renovation is performed by a licensed contractor. All building permits and any construction, repairs, or renovations performed in conjunction with such permits must comply with the applicable provisions of chapters 489 and 553.

(a) Site rehabilitation work on sites which are eligible for state-funded cleanup from the fund pursuant to this section and ss. 376.305(6), 376.3072, and 376.3073 may only be funded pursuant to this section. A facility operator shall abate the source of discharge for a new release that occurred after March 29, 1995. If free product is present, the operator shall notify the department, and the department may direct the removal of the free product. The department shall grant approval to continue site rehabilitation pursuant to this section.

(b) When contracting for site rehabilitation activities performed under the Petroleum Restoration Program, the department shall comply with competitive procurement requirements provided in chapter 287 or rules adopted under this section or s. 287.0595.

(c) Each contractor performing site assessment and remediation activities for state-funded sites under this section shall certify to the department that the contractor meets all certification and license requirements imposed by law. Each contractor shall certify to the department that the contractor meets the following minimum qualifications:1. Complies with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations.2. Maintains workers’ compensation insurance for employees as required by the Florida Workers’ Compensation Law.3. Maintains comprehensive general liability and comprehensive automobile liability insurance with minimum limits of at least $1 million per occurrence and $1 million annual aggregate to pay claims for damage for personal injury, including accidental death, as well as claims for property damage that may arise from performance of work under the program, which insurance designates the state as an additional insured party.4. Maintains professional liability insurance of at least $1 million per occurrence and $1 million annual aggregate.5. Has the capacity to perform or directly supervise the majority of the rehabilitation work at a site pursuant to s. 489.113(9).

(d) The department rules implementing this section must specify that only qualified vendors may submit responses on a competitive solicitation. The department rules must also include procedures for the rejection of vendors not meeting the minimum qualifications on the opening of a competitive solicitation and requirements for a vendor to maintain its qualifications in order to enter contracts or perform rehabilitation work.

(e) A contractor that performs services pursuant to this subsection may file invoices for payment with the department for the services described in the approved contract. The invoices for payment must be submitted to the department on forms provided by the department, together with evidence documenting that activities were conducted or completed pursuant to the approved contract. If there are sufficient unencumbered funds available in the fund which have been appropriated for expenditure by the Legislature, and if all of the terms of the approved contract have been met, invoices for payment must be paid pursuant to s. 215.422. After a contractor has submitted its invoices to the department, and before payment is made, the contractor may assign its right to payment to another person without recourse of the assignee or assignor to the state. In such cases, the assignee must be paid pursuant to s. 215.422. Prior notice of the assignment and assignment information must be made to the department and must be signed and notarized by the assigning party.

(f) The contractor shall submit an invoice to the department within 30 days after the date of the department’s written acceptance of each interim deliverable or written approval of the final deliverable specified in the approved contract.

(g) The department shall make payments based on the terms of an approved contract for site rehabilitation work. The department may, based on its experience and the past performance and concerns regarding a contractor, retain up to 25 percent of the contracted amount or use performance bonds to ensure performance. The amount of retainage and the amount of performance bonds, as well as the terms and conditions for such, must be included in the approved contract.

(h) The contractor, or the person to whom the contractor has assigned its right to payment pursuant to paragraph (e), shall make prompt payment to subcontractors and suppliers for their costs associated with an approved contract pursuant to s. 287.0585, except that the contractor, or the person to whom the contractor has assigned its right to payment pursuant to paragraph (e), may remit payments to subcontractors and suppliers within 30 working days after the contractor’s receipt of payment by the department before the penalties required by s. 287.0585(1) are applicable.

(i) The exemption under s. 287.0585(2) does not apply to payments associated with an approved contract.

(j) The department may withhold payment if the validity or accuracy of a contractor’s invoices or supporting documents is in question.

(k) This section does not authorize payment to a person for costs of contaminated soil treatment or disposal that does not meet the applicable rules of this state for such treatment or disposal, including all general permitting, state air emission standards, monitoring, sampling, and reporting rules more specifically described in department rules.

(l) The department shall terminate or suspend a contractor’s eligibility for participation in the program if the contractor fails to perform its contractual duties for site rehabilitation program tasks.

(m) A site owner or operator, or his or her designee, may not receive any remuneration, in cash or in kind, directly or indirectly, from a rehabilitation contractor performing site cleanup activities pursuant to this section.

(a) All excise taxes levied, collected, and credited to the fund in accordance with ss. 206.9935(3) and 206.9945(1)(c).

(b) All penalties, judgments, recoveries, reimbursements, and other fees and charges credited to the fund pursuant to subsection (3).

(a) Except as provided in subsection (10) and as otherwise provided by law, the department shall recover to the use of the fund from a person or persons at any time causing or having caused the discharge or from the Federal Government, jointly and severally, all sums owed or expended from the fund pursuant to s. 376.308, except that the department may decline to pursue such recovery if it finds the amount involved too small or the likelihood of recovery too uncertain. Sums recovered as a result of damage due to a discharge related to the storage of petroleum or petroleum products or other similar disaster shall be apportioned between the fund and the General Revenue Fund so as to repay the full costs to the General Revenue Fund of sums disbursed therefrom as a result of such disaster. A request for reimbursement to the fund for such costs, if not paid within 30 days after demand, shall be turned over to the department for collection.

(b) Except as provided in subsection (10) and as otherwise provided by law, it is the duty of the department in administering the fund diligently to pursue the reimbursement to the fund of any sum expended from the fund for cleanup and abatement pursuant to this section or s. 376.3073, unless the department finds the amount involved too small or the likelihood of recovery too uncertain. For the purposes of s. 95.11, the limitation period within which to institute an action to recover such sums shall begin on the last date on which such sums were expended and not the date on which the discharge occurred.

(c)1. The department may perform financial and technical audits in order to verify site restoration costs and ensure compliance with this chapter. The department shall seek recovery of any overpayment based on the findings of the audits. The department must begin an audit within 5 years after the date of payment for costs incurred at a facility, except in cases where the department alleges specific facts indicating fraud.2. Upon determination by the department that any portion of costs that have been paid from the fund is disallowed, the department shall provide written notice to the recipient of the payment specifying the allegations of fact that justify the department’s proposed action and ordering repayment of disallowed costs within 60 days after receipt of such notice.3. If the recipient does not make payment to the department within 60 days after receipt of such notice, the department shall seek recovery in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover the overpayment, unless the department finds the amount involved too small or the likelihood of recovery too uncertain.4. In addition to the amount of the overpayment, the recipient is liable to the department for interest of 1 percent per month or the prime rate, whichever is less, on the amount of the overpayment from the date of the overpayment by the department until the recipient satisfies the department’s request for repayment pursuant to this paragraph. The accrual of interest shall be tolled during the pendency of any litigation.

(d) Claims that accrued under former reimbursement or preapproval programs are expressly preserved.

(e) If the department initiates an enforcement action to clean up a contaminated site and determines that the responsible party cannot financially undertake complete restoration of the contaminated site, that the current property owner was not responsible for the discharge when the contamination first occurred, or that the state’s interest can best be served by conducting cleanup, the department may enter into an agreement with the responsible party or property owner whereby the department agrees to conduct site rehabilitation and the responsible party or property owner agrees to pay for the portion of the cleanup costs that are within such party’s or owner’s financial capabilities as determined by the department, taking into consideration the party’s or owner’s net worth and the economic impact on the party or owner.

(a) The department shall establish reasonable requirements for the written reporting of petroleum contamination incidents and shall distribute forms to registrants under s. 376.303(1)(b) and to other interested parties upon request to be used for such purpose. Until such forms are available for distribution, the department shall take reports of such incidents, however made, but shall notify any person making such a report that a complete written report of the incident will be required by the department at a later time, the form for which will be provided by the department.

(b) When reporting forms become available for distribution, all sites involving incidents of contamination from petroleum storage systems initially reported to the department at any time from midnight on June 30, 1986, to midnight on December 31, 1988, shall be qualified sites if a complete written report is filed with respect thereto within a reasonable time. Subject to the delays which may occur as a result of the prioritization of sites under paragraph (5)(a) for any qualified site, costs for activities described in paragraphs (4)(a)-(e) shall be absorbed at the expense of the fund, without recourse to reimbursement or recovery, with the following exceptions:1. This subsection does not apply to a site where the department has been denied site access to implement this section.2. This subsection does not authorize or require reimbursement from the fund for costs expended before the beginning of the grace period.3.a. Upon discovery by the department that the owner or operator of a petroleum storage system has been grossly negligent in the maintenance of such petroleum storage system; has, with willful intent to conceal the existence of a serious discharge, falsified inventory or reconciliation records maintained with respect to the site at which such system is located; or has intentionally damaged such petroleum storage system, the site at which such system is located shall be ineligible for participation in the incentive program and the owner shall be liable for all costs due to discharges from petroleum storage systems at that site, any other provisions of chapter 86-159, Laws of Florida, to the contrary notwithstanding. For the purposes of this paragraph, willful failure to maintain inventory and reconciliation records, willful failure to make monthly monitoring system checks where such systems are in place, and failure to meet monitoring and retrofitting requirements within the schedules established under chapter 62-761, Florida Administrative Code, or violation of similar rules adopted by the department under this chapter, constitutes gross negligence in the maintenance of a petroleum storage system.b. The department shall redetermine the eligibility of petroleum storage systems for which a timely Early Detection Incentive Program application was filed, but which were deemed ineligible by the department, under the following conditions:(I) The owner or operator, on or before March 31, 1991, shall submit, in writing, notification that the storage system is now in compliance with department rules adopted pursuant to s. 376.303, and which requests the department to reevaluate the storage system eligibility; and(II) The department verifies the storage system compliance based on a compliance inspection.A site may be determined eligible by the department for good cause shown, including, but not limited to, demonstration by the owner or operator that to achieve compliance would cause an increase in the potential for the spread of the contamination.c. Redetermination of eligibility pursuant to sub-subparagraph b. shall not be available to:(I) Petroleum storage systems owned or operated by the Federal Government.(II) Facilities that denied site access to the department.(III) Facilities where a discharge was intentionally concealed.(IV) Facilities that were denied eligibility due to:(A) Absence of contamination, unless any such facility subsequently establishes that contamination did exist at that facility on or before December 31, 1988.(B) Contamination from substances that were not petroleum or a petroleum product.(C) Contamination that was not from a petroleum storage system.d. Applicants who demonstrate compliance for a site pursuant to sub-subparagraph b. are eligible for the Early Detection Incentive Program and site rehabilitation funding pursuant to subsections (5) and (6).If, in order to avoid prolonged delay, the department in its discretion deems it necessary to expend sums from the fund to cover ineligible sites or costs as set forth in this paragraph, the department may do so and seek recovery and reimbursement therefor in the same manner and pursuant to the same procedures established for recovery and reimbursement of sums otherwise owed to or expended from the fund.

(c) A report of a discharge made to the department by a person pursuant to this subsection or rules adopted pursuant to this subsection may not be used directly as evidence of liability for such discharge in any civil or criminal trial arising out of the discharge.

(d) This subsection does not apply to petroleum storage systems owned or operated by the Federal Government.

(a) Falsify inventory or reconciliation records maintained in compliance with chapters 62-761 and 62-762, Florida Administrative Code, with willful intent to conceal the existence of a serious leak; or

(b) Intentionally damage a petroleum storage system.

(a) Voluntary cleanup.—This section does not prohibit a person from conducting site rehabilitation through his or her own personnel or through responsible response action contractors or subcontractors when such person is not seeking site rehabilitation funding from the fund. Such voluntary cleanups must meet all applicable environmental standards.

(b) Low-scored site initiative.—Notwithstanding subsections (5) and (6), a site with a priority ranking score of 29 points or less may voluntarily participate in the low-scored site initiative regardless of whether the site is eligible for state restoration funding.1. To participate in the low-scored site initiative, the property owner, or a responsible party who provides evidence of authorization from the property owner, must submit a “No Further Action” proposal and affirmatively demonstrate that the conditions imposed under subparagraph 4. are met.2. Upon affirmative demonstration that the conditions imposed under subparagraph 4. are met, the department shall issue a site rehabilitation completion order incorporating the “No Further Action” proposal submitted by the property owner or the responsible party, who must provide evidence of authorization from the property owner. If no contamination is detected, the department may issue a site rehabilitation completion order.3. Sites that are eligible for state restoration funding may receive payment of costs for the low-scored site initiative as follows:a. A property owner, or a responsible party who provides evidence of authorization from the property owner, may submit an assessment and limited remediation plan designed to affirmatively demonstrate that the site meets the conditions imposed under subparagraph 4. Notwithstanding the priority ranking score of the site, the department may approve the cost of the assessment and limited remediation, including up to 12 months of groundwater monitoring and 12 months of limited remediation activities in one or more task assignments or modifications thereof, not to exceed the threshold amount provided in s. 287.017 for CATEGORY TWO, for each site where the department has determined that the assessment and limited remediation, if applicable, will likely result in a determination of “No Further Action.” The department may not pay the costs associated with the establishment of institutional or engineering controls other than the costs associated with a professional land survey or a specific purpose survey, if such is needed, and the costs associated with obtaining a title report and paying recording fees.b. After the approval of initial site assessment results provided pursuant to state funding under sub-subparagraph a., the department may approve an additional amount not to exceed the threshold amount provided in s. 287.017 for CATEGORY TWO for limited remediation needed to achieve a determination of “No Further Action.”c. The assessment and limited remediation work shall be completed no later than 15 months after the department authorizes the start of a state-funded, low-score site initiative task. If groundwater monitoring is required after the assessment and limited remediation in order to satisfy the conditions under subparagraph 4., the department may authorize an additional 12 months to complete the monitoring.d. No more than $15 million for the low-scored site initiative may be encumbered from the fund in any fiscal year. Funds shall be made available on a first-come, first-served basis and shall be limited to 10 sites in each fiscal year for each property owner or each responsible party who provides evidence of authorization from the property owner.e. Program deductibles, copayments, and the limited contamination assessment report requirements under paragraph (13)(d) do not apply to expenditures under this paragraph.4. The department shall issue an order incorporating the “No Further Action” proposal submitted by a property owner or a responsible party who provides evidence of authorization from the property owner upon affirmative demonstration that all of the following conditions are met:a. Soil saturated with petroleum or petroleum products, or soil that causes a total corrected hydrocarbon measurement of 500 parts per million or higher for the Gasoline Analytical Group or 50 parts per million or higher for the Kerosene Analytical Group, as defined by department rule, does not exist onsite as a result of a release of petroleum products.b. A minimum of 12 months of groundwater monitoring indicates that the plume is shrinking or stable.c. The release of petroleum products at the site does not adversely affect adjacent surface waters, including their effects on human health and the environment.d. The area containing the petroleum products’ chemicals of concern:(I) Is confined to the source property boundaries of the real property on which the discharge originated, unless the property owner has requested or authorized a more limited area in the “No Further Action” proposal submitted under this subsection; or(II) Has migrated from the source property onto or beneath a transportation facility as defined in s. 334.03(30) for which the department has approved, and the governmental entity owning the transportation facility has agreed to institutional controls as defined in s. 376.301(21). This sub-sub-subparagraph does not, however, impose any legal liability on the transportation facility owner, obligate such owner to engage in remediation, or waive such owner’s right to recover costs for damages.e. The groundwater contamination containing the petroleum products’ chemicals of concern is not a threat to any permitted potable water supply well.f. Soils onsite found between land surface and 2 feet below land surface which are subject to human exposure meet the soil cleanup target levels established in subparagraph (5)(b)9., or human exposure is limited by appropriate institutional or engineering controls.Issuance of a site rehabilitation completion order under this paragraph acknowledges that minimal contamination exists onsite and that such contamination is not a threat to the public health, safety, or welfare; water resources; or the environment. Pursuant to subsection (4), the issuance of the site rehabilitation completion order, with or without conditions, does not alter eligibility for state-funded rehabilitation that would otherwise be applicable under this section.

(a)1. The department shall accept any discharge reporting form received before January 1, 1995, as an application for this program, and the facility owner or operator need not reapply.2. Regardless of whether ownership has changed, owners or operators of property that is contaminated by petroleum or petroleum products from a petroleum storage system may apply for such program by filing a written report of the contamination incident, including evidence that such incident occurred before January 1, 1995, with the department. Incidents of petroleum contamination discovered after December 31, 1994, at sites which have not stored petroleum or petroleum products for consumption, use, or sale after such date shall be presumed to have occurred before January 1, 1995. An operator’s filed report shall be an application of the owner for all purposes.

(b) Subject to annual appropriation from the fund, sites meeting the criteria of this subsection are eligible for up to $400,000 of site rehabilitation funding assistance in priority order pursuant to subsections (5) and (6). Sites meeting the criteria of this subsection for which a site rehabilitation completion order was issued before June 1, 2008, do not qualify for the 2008 increase in site rehabilitation funding assistance and are bound by the pre-June 1, 2008, limits. Sites meeting the criteria of this subsection for which a site rehabilitation completion order was not issued before June 1, 2008, regardless of whether they have previously transitioned to nonstate-funded cleanup status, may continue state-funded cleanup pursuant to this section until a site rehabilitation completion order is issued or the increased site rehabilitation funding assistance limit is reached, whichever occurs first. The department may not pay expenses incurred beyond the scope of an approved contract.

(c) The department may also approve supplemental funding of up to $100,000 for additional remediation and monitoring if such remediation and monitoring is necessary to achieve a determination of “No Further Action.”

(d) Upon notification by the department that rehabilitation funding assistance is available for the site pursuant to subsections (5) and (6), the property owner, operator, or person otherwise responsible for site rehabilitation shall provide the department with a limited contamination assessment report and shall enter into a Petroleum Cleanup Participation Program site rehabilitation agreement with the department. The limited contamination assessment report must be sufficient to support the proposed course of action and to estimate the cost of the proposed course of action. The agreement must provide for a 25-percent cost savings to the department; a copayment by the owner, operator, or person otherwise responsible for conducting site rehabilitation; or a combination of cost savings and a copayment. Cost savings to the department may be demonstrated in the form of reduced rates by the proposed agency term contractor or the difference in cost associated with a Risk Management Options Level I closure versus a Risk Management Options Level II closure. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term:1. “Risk Management Options Level I” means a “No Further Action” closure without institutional controls or without institutional and engineering controls. This closure option applies subject to conditions in department rules and agreements.2. “Risk Management Options Level II” means a “No Further Action” closure where institutional controls and, if appropriate, engineering controls apply if the controls are protective of human health, public safety, and the environment. This closure option applies subject to conditions in department rules and agreements.

(e) A report of a discharge made to the department by a person pursuant to this subsection or any rules adopted pursuant to this subsection may not be used directly as evidence of liability for such discharge in any civil or criminal trial arising out of the discharge.

(f) This subsection does not preclude the department from pursuing penalties under s. 403.141 for violations of any law or any rule, order, permit, registration, or certification adopted or issued by the department pursuant to its lawful authority.

(g) Upon the filing of a discharge reporting form under paragraph (a), the department or local government may not pursue any judicial or enforcement action to compel rehabilitation of the discharge. This paragraph does not prevent any such action with respect to discharges determined ineligible under this subsection or to sites for which rehabilitation funding assistance is available pursuant to subsections (5) and (6).

(h) The following are excluded from participation in the program:1. Sites at which the department has been denied reasonable site access to implement this section.2. Sites that were active facilities when owned or operated by the Federal Government.3. Sites that are identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to be on, or which qualify for listing on, the National Priorities List under Superfund. This exception does not apply to those sites for which eligibility has been requested or granted as of the effective date of this act under the Early Detection Incentive Program established pursuant to s. 15, chapter 86-159, Laws of Florida.4. Sites for which contamination is covered under the Early Detection Incentive Program, the Abandoned Tank Restoration Program, or the Petroleum Liability and Restoration Insurance Program, in which case site rehabilitation funding assistance shall continue under the respective program.

(a) A petroleum storage system owner or operator may request payment from the department for the repair or replacement of petroleum storage tanks, integral piping, or ancillary equipment that may have been damaged, or is subject to damage, by the storage of fuels blended with ethanol or biodiesel or for other preventive measures to ensure compatibility with ethanol or biodiesel in accordance with the following procedures:1. The petroleum storage system owner or operator may submit a request for payment to the department along with the following information:a. An affidavit from a petroleum storage system specialty contractor attesting to an opinion that the petroleum storage system may have been damaged as a result of the storage of fuel blended with ethanol or biodiesel or may not be compatible with fuels containing ethanol or biodiesel, or a combination of both. The affidavit must also include a proposal from the specialty contractor for repair or replacement of the equipment, or for the implementation of other preventive measures to reduce the probability of damage. If the specialty contractor proposes replacement of any equipment, the affidavit must include the reasons that repair or other preventive measures are not technically or economically feasible or practical.b. Copies of any inspection reports, including photographs, prepared by the specialty contractor or department or local program inspectors documenting the damage or potential for damage to the petroleum storage system.c. A proposal from the specialty contractor showing the proposed scope of the repair, replacement, or other preventive measures, including a detailed list of labor, equipment, and other associated costs. In the case of replacement or repair, the proposal must also include provisions for any preventive measures needed to prevent a recurrence of the damage, such as the use of corrosion inhibitors, the application of coatings compatible with ethanol or biodiesel, as appropriate, and the adoption of a maintenance plan.d. For proposals to replace storage tanks or piping, a statement from a certified public accountant indicating the depreciated value of the tanks or piping proposed for replacement. Applications for such proposals must also include documentation of the age of the storage tank or piping. Historical tank registration records may be used to determine the age of the storage tank and piping. The depreciated value shall be the maximum allowable replacement cost for the storage tank and piping, exclusive of labor costs. For the purposes of this paragraph, tanks that are 20 years old or older are deemed to be fully depreciated and have no replacement value.2. The department shall review applications for completeness, accuracy, and the reasonableness of costs and scope of work. Within 30 days after receipt of an application, the department must approve or deny the application, propose modification to the application, or request additional information.

(b) If an application is approved, the department shall issue a purchase order to the petroleum storage system owner or operator. The purchase order shall:1. Reflect a payment due to the owner for the cost of the scope of work approved by the department, less a deductible of 25 percent.2. State that a payment is not due to the owner pursuant to the purchase order until the scope of work authorized by the department has been completed in substantial conformity with the purchase order.3. Except for preventive maintenance contracts, specify that the work authorized in the purchase order must be substantially completed and paid for by the petroleum storage system owner or operator within 180 days after the date of the purchase order. After such time, the purchase order is void.4. For preventive maintenance contracts, the department shall develop a maintenance completion and payment schedule for approved applicants. The failure of an owner or operator to meet scheduled payments shall invalidate the purchase order for all future payments due pursuant to the order.

(c)1. Except for maintenance contracts, the applicant may request that the department make payment following completion of the work authorized by the department, in accordance with the terms of the purchase order. The request must include a sufficient demonstration that the work has been completed in substantial compliance with the purchase order and that the costs have been fully paid. Upon such a showing, the department must issue the payment pursuant to the terms of the purchase order.2. For maintenance contracts, the department must make periodic payments pursuant to the schedule specified in the purchase order upon satisfactory showing that maintenance work has been completed and costs have been paid by the owner or operator as specified in the purchase order.

(d) The department may develop forms to be used for application and payment procedures. Until such forms are developed, an applicant may submit the required information in any format, as long as the documentation is complete.

(e) The department may request the assistance of the Department of Management Services or a third-party administrator to assist in the administration of the application and payment process. Any costs associated with this administration shall be paid from the funds identified in this section.

(f) This subsection does not affect the obligations of facility owners or operators or petroleum storage system owners or operators to timely comply with department rules regarding the maintenance, replacement, and repair of petroleum storage systems in order to prevent a release or discharge of pollutants.

1(g) Payments may not be made for the following:1. Proposal costs or costs related to preparation of the application and required documentation;2. Certified public accountant costs;3. Except as provided in paragraph (j), any costs in excess of the amount approved by the department under paragraph (b) or which are not in substantial compliance with the purchase order;4. Costs associated with storage tanks, piping, or ancillary equipment that has previously been repaired or replaced for which costs have been paid under this section;5. Facilities that are not in compliance with department storage tank rules, until the noncompliance issues have been resolved; or6. Costs associated with damage to petroleum storage systems caused in whole or in part by causes other than the storage of fuels blended with ethanol or biodiesel.

(h) Applications may be submitted on a first-come, first-served basis. However, the department may not issue purchase orders unless funds remain for the current fiscal year.

(i) A petroleum storage system owner or operator may not receive more than $200,000 annually for equipment replacement, repair, or preventive measures at any single facility, or $500,000 annually in aggregate for all facilities owned or operated by the owner or operator it owns or operates.

(j) Owners or operators that have incurred costs for repair, replacement, or other preventive measures as described in this subsection during the period of July 1, 2015, through June 30, 2019, may apply to request payment for such costs from the department using the procedure in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d). The department may not disburse payment for approved applications for such work until all purchase orders for previously approved applications have been paid and unless funds remain available for the fiscal year. Such payment is subject to a deductible of 25 percent of the cost of the scope of work approved by the department under this paragraph.

(k) For new petroleum requirement registrations after July 1, 2019, the department shall only register equipment that meets applicable standards for compatibility for ethanol blends, biodiesel blends, and other alternative fuels that are likely to be stored in such systems.

"(a) The State Geologist and his or her professional staff shall conduct field and laboratory investigations of the geologic structure of this state; the nature and composition of the igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks and economic minerals; the nature of physiographic features; and other aspects of geology and hydrology which may lead to a better understanding of the geology of this state, with special reference to the practical bearing of the subjects of such investigations on the well-being of this state and the citizens of this state.

(b) The State Geologist shall provide technical assistance to, and consult and cooperate with, the general public; other agencies of federal, state, and local government; and industry. The State Geologist shall also consider scientific, educational, and economic questions related to the geology and hydrology of the state which are of value to the people of this state.

(c) The State Geologist shall prepare and publish Florida Geological Survey reports, with necessary illustrations and maps, which provide general and detailed descriptions of the geology and earth resources of this state, shall maintain a comprehensive research library, open to the public, of published and unpublished geological information, and shall otherwise disseminate geological information to the citizens of this state.

(d) The department may contract with the government of the United States, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, or with this state or any county, municipality, district authority, or political subdivision of this state, or with any private person, to assist in providing this state with geologic information or to accomplish the purposes of this act. The department may receive and accept from any federal agency, state agency, or other public body grants or loans for or in aid of the purposes of this act, and the department may receive and accept aid, contributions, or loans from any other source of money, property, labor, or other thing of value to be held, used, and applied only for the purposes for which such aid, grants, or loans were made.

"(a) Unit operation of the field, or of any pool or pools, portion or portions, or combinations thereof within the field, is reasonably necessary to prevent waste, to avoid the drilling of unnecessary wells, or to increase the ultimate recovery of oil or gas by additional recovery methods;

(b) The estimated additional cost incident to the conduct of such operation will not exceed the value of the estimated additional recovery of oil or gas; and

(c) The additional recovery of oil or gas does not adversely interfere with the storage or recovery of natural gas within a natural gas storage reservoir.

(a) A description of the area embraced, termed the “unit area” and a description of the pool or pools, or portions thereof, affected and lying within the unit area.

(b) A statement of the nature of the operations contemplated.

(c) A method of allocation among the separately owned tracts in the unit area of all the oil or gas, or both, produced from the unit pool within the unit area and not required in the conduct of such operation or unavoidably lost, such method of allocation to be on a formula that is fair and equitable and that will protect the correlative rights of all interested parties.

(d) A provision for adjustment among the owners of the unit area (not including royalty owners) of their respective investments in wells, tanks, pumps, machinery, materials, equipment, and other things and services of value attributable to the unit operations. The amount to be charged unit operations for any such item shall be determined by the owners of the unit area (not including royalty owners). However, if said owners of the unit area are unable to agree upon the amount of such charges or upon the correctness thereof, the department shall determine the amount. The net amount charged against the owners of a separately owned tract shall be considered expense of unit operation chargeable against such tract. The adjustment provided for herein may be treated separately and handled by agreements separate from the unitization agreement.

(e) A provision that the costs and expenses of unit operation, including investment, past and prospective, be charged to the separately owned tracts in the same proportions that such tracts share in unit production. The expenses chargeable to a tract shall be paid by the person not entitled to share in production free of operating costs and who, in the absence of unit operation, would be responsible for the expense of developing and operating such tracts, and such person’s interest in the separately owned tract shall be primarily responsible therefor. The obligation or liability of such persons in the several, separately owned tracts for the payment of unit expense shall at all times be several, and not joint or collective. The unit operator shall have a first and prior lien upon:1. The leasehold estate, exclusive of the royalty interest provided thereby, and upon unleased oil and gas rights, exclusive of one-eighth interest therein, in and to each separately owned tract; and2. The interest of the owners thereof in and to the unit production and all equipment in possession of the unit,to secure the payment of the amount of the unit expense charged to and assessed against such separately owned tract.

(f) The designation of, or a provision for the selection of, a unit operator. The conduct of all unit operations by the unit operator and the selection of a successor to the unit operator shall be governed by the terms and provisions of the unitization agreements.

(g) A provision that when the full amount of any charge made against any interest in a separately owned tract is not paid when due by the person or persons primarily responsible therefor, then all of the oil and gas production allocated to the interest in default in such separately owned tract, upon which operator has a lien, may be appropriated by the unit operator and marketed and sold for the payment of such charge, together with interest at a rate of 6 percent per annum. The remaining portion of the unit production, or the proceeds derived therefrom, allocated to each separately owned tract shall in all events be regarded as royalty to be paid to the owners, free and clear of all unit expense and free and clear of any lien therefor. The owner of any overriding royalty, oil and gas payment, or other interest who is not primarily responsible for the unpaid obligation shall, to the extent of any payment or deduction from his or her share, be subrogated to all the rights of the unit operator with respect to the interest or interests primarily responsible for such payment. Any surplus received by the operator from any such sale of production shall be credited to the person or persons from whom it was deducted, in the proportion of their respective interest.

(h) The time the unit operation shall become effective and the manner in which, and the circumstances under which, the unit operation shall terminate.

(a) A contract incorporating the unitization agreement has been signed or ratified or approved in writing by the owners of at least 75 percent in interest as costs are shared under the terms of the order and by 75 percent in interest as production is to be allocated to the royalty owners in the unit area. If any entity owns both royalty interests and interests responsible for costs, such party may vote as an owner responsible for costs or as a royalty owner, at his or her election, but not as both, and the entity’s interest that is not voted shall be excluded in calculating the percentages of consent and nonconsent.

(b) A contract incorporating the required arrangements for operations has been signed or ratified or approved in writing by the owners of at least 75 percent in interest as costs are shared,

(5)(a) The department, by entry of new or amending orders, may from time to time add to unit operations portions of pools not theretofore included, may add to unit operations new pools or portions thereof, and may extend the unit area as required. Any such order, in providing for allocation of production from a unitized zone of the unit area, shall first allocate to such pool or pools or portion thereof so added a portion of the total production of oil or gas, or both, from all pools affected within the unit area, as enlarged, and not required in the conduct of unit operations or unavoidably lost; such allocation to be based on a formula for sharing that is considered to treat each tract and each owner fairly and equitably during the remaining course of unit operations. The production so allocated to such added pool or pools or portions thereof shall be allocated to the separately owned tracts which participate in such production on a fair and equitable basis. The remaining portion of unit production shall be allocated among the separately owned tracts within the previously established unit area in the same proportions as those specified prior to the enlargement unless such proportions are shown to be erroneous by data developed subsequent to the former determination, in which event the errors shall be corrected. Orders promulgated under this section shall become operative at 7 a.m. on the first day of the month next following the day on which the order becomes effective.

(b) An order promulgated by the department shall not become effective unless and until:1. All of the terms and provisions of the unitization agreement relating to the extension or enlargement of the unit area or to the addition of pools or portions thereof to unit operations have been fulfilled and satisfied and evidence thereof has been submitted to the department.2. The extension or addition effected by such order has been agreed to in writing by the owners of at least 75 percent in interest as costs are shared in the area or pools or portions thereof to be added to the unit operation by such order and by 75 percent in interest as production is to be allocated to the royalty owners in the area or pools or portions thereof to be added to the unit operations by such order and evidence thereof has been submitted to the department. If any entity owns both royalty interests and interests responsible for costs, such party may vote as an owner responsible for costs or as a royalty owner, at his or her election, but not as both, and the entity’s interest that is not voted shall be excluded in calculating the percentages of consent and nonconsent.In the event both of the requirements specified in subparagraphs 1. and 2. are not fulfilled within 6 months after the date of such order, or within such extended period as the department may prescribe, it shall be automatically revoked.

"(1)(a) The state land planning agency may from time to time recommend to the Administration Commission specific areas of critical state concern. In its recommendation, the agency shall include recommendations with respect to the purchase of lands situated within the boundaries of the proposed area as environmentally endangered lands and outdoor recreation lands under the Land Conservation Program. The agency also shall include any report or recommendation of a resource planning and management committee appointed pursuant to s. 380.045; the dangers that would result from uncontrolled or inadequate development of the area and the advantages that would be achieved from the development of the area in a coordinated manner; a detailed boundary description of the proposed area; specific principles for guiding development within the area; an inventory of lands owned by the state, federal, county, and municipal governments within the proposed area; and a list of the state agencies with programs that affect the purpose of the designation. The agency shall recommend actions which the local government and state and regional agencies must accomplish in order to implement the principles for guiding development. These actions may include, but need not be limited to, revisions of the local comprehensive plan and adoption of land development regulations, density requirements, and special permitting requirements.

(b) Within 45 days following receipt of a recommendation from the agency, the commission shall either reject the recommendation as tendered or adopt the recommendation with or without modification and by rule designate the area of critical state concern. Any rule that designates an area of critical state concern must include:1. A detailed boundary description of the area.2. Principles for guiding development.3. A clear statement of the purpose for the designation.4. A precise checklist of actions which, when implemented, will result in repeal of the designation by the Administration Commission, and the agencies or entities responsible for taking those actions.5. A list of those issues or programs for which mechanisms must be in place to assure ongoing implementation of the actions taken to result in repeal of the designation.6. A list of the state agencies which, in addition to those specified in subsection (22), administer programs that affect the purpose of the designation.The rule shall become effective 20 days after being filed with the Secretary of State, except that an emergency rule adopted by the commission and designating an area of critical state concern shall become effective immediately on being filed. Any rule adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall be presented to the Legislature for review pursuant to paragraph (c). A statement of estimated regulatory costs prepared pursuant to s. 120.541 shall not be a ground for a challenge of the rule; however, a landowner shall not be precluded from using adverse economic results as grounds for challenge. Such principles for guiding development shall apply to any development undertaken subsequent to the legislative review pursuant to paragraph (c) of the designation of the area of critical state concern with or without modification but prior to the adoption of land development rules and regulations or a local comprehensive plan for the critical area pursuant to subsections (6) and (8). No boundaries or principles for guiding development shall be adopted without a specific finding by the commission that the boundaries or principles are consistent with the purpose of the designation. The commission is not authorized to adopt any rule that would provide for a moratorium on development in any area of critical state concern.

(c) A rule adopted by the commission pursuant to paragraph (b) designating an area of critical state concern and principles for guiding development shall be submitted to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives for review no later than 30 days prior to the next regular session of the Legislature. The Legislature may reject, modify, or take no action relative to the adopted rule. In its deliberations, the Legislature may consider, among other factors, whether a resource planning and management committee has established a program pursuant to s. 380.045. In addition to any other data and information required pursuant to this chapter, each rule presented to the Legislature shall include a detailed legal description of the boundary of the area of critical state concern, proposed principles for guiding development, and a detailed statement of how the area meets the criteria for designation as provided in subsection (2).

(d) If, after the repeal of the boundary designation of an area of critical state concern pursuant to subsection (15), the state land planning agency determines that the administration of the local land development regulations or a local comprehensive plan within a formerly designated area is inadequate to protect the former area of critical state concern, then the state land planning agency may recommend to the commission that the area be redesignated as an area of critical state concern. Within 45 days following the receipt of the recommendation from the agency, the commission shall either reject the recommendation as tendered or adopt the same with or without modification. The commission may, by rule, make such redesignation effective immediately, at which time the boundaries, regulations, and plans in effect at the time the previous designation was repealed shall be reinstated. Within 90 days of such redesignation, the commission shall begin rulemaking procedures to designate the area an area of critical state concern under paragraph (b).

(a) An area containing, or having a significant impact upon, environmental or natural resources of regional or statewide importance, including, but not limited to, state or federal parks, forests, wildlife refuges, wilderness areas, aquatic preserves, major rivers and estuaries, state environmentally endangered lands, Outstanding Florida Waters, and aquifer recharge areas, the uncontrolled private or public development of which would cause substantial deterioration of such resources. Specific criteria which shall be considered in designating an area under this paragraph include:1. Whether the economic value of the area, as determined by the type, variety, distribution, relative scarcity, and condition of the environmental or natural resources within the area, is of substantial regional or statewide importance.2. Whether the ecological value of the area, as determined by the physical and biological components of the environmental system, is of substantial regional or statewide importance.3. Whether the area is a designated critical habitat of any state or federally designated threatened or endangered plant or animal species.4. Whether the area is inherently susceptible to substantial development due to its geographic location or natural aesthetics.5. Whether any existing or planned substantial development within the area will directly, significantly, and deleteriously affect any or all of the environmental or natural resources of the area which are of regional or statewide importance.

(b) An area containing, or having a significant impact upon, historical or archaeological resources, sites, or statutorily defined historical or archaeological districts, the private or public development of which would cause substantial deterioration or complete loss of such resources, sites, or districts. Specific criteria which shall be considered in designating an area under this paragraph include:1. Whether the area is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the history of the state or region.2. Whether the area is associated with the lives of persons who are significant to the history of the state or region.3. Whether the area contains any structure that embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, that represents the work of a master, that possesses high artistic values, or that represents a significant and distinguishable entity the components of which may lack individual distinction and which are of regional or statewide importance.4. Whether the area has yielded, or will likely yield, information important to the prehistory or history of the state or region.

(c) An area having a significant impact upon, or being significantly impacted by, an existing or proposed major public facility or other area of major public investment including, but not limited to, highways, ports, airports, energy facilities, and water management projects.

(a)1. Within 6 months after the effective date of the rule or statute that designates an area of critical state concern, and at any time thereafter as directed by the Administration Commission, the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Health, the water management districts with jurisdiction over any portion of the area of critical state concern, and any other state agency specified in the designation rule, shall each submit a report to the Administration Commission, and a copy of the report to the state land planning agency. The report shall evaluate the effect of the reporting agency’s programs upon the purpose of the designation.2. If different permitting standards or criteria, or other changes to the program, are necessary in order to further the purpose of the designation, the report shall recommend rules which further that purpose and which are consistent with the principles for guiding development. The report shall explain and justify the reasons for any different permitting standards or criteria that may be recommended. The commission shall reject the agency’s recommendation, or accept it with or without modification and direct the agency to adopt rules, including any changes. Any rule adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall be consistent with the principles for guiding development, and shall apply only within the boundary of the designated area. The agency shall file a copy of the adopted rule with the Administration Commission and the state land planning agency.3. If statutory changes are required in order to implement the permitting standards or criteria that are necessary to further the purpose of the designation, the report shall recommend statutory amendments. The Administration Commission shall submit any report that recommends statutory amendments to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, together with the Administration Commission’s recommendation on the proposed amendments.

(b) The Administration Commission has authority to adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 to implement the provisions of this subsection.

(c) In accordance with applicable local government ordinances, newly developed property receiving a certificate of occupancy, or its equivalent, on or after July 1, 2012, that is used for multifamily residential or commercial purposes, must provide adequate space and an adequate receptacle for recycling by tenants and owners of the property. This provision is limited to counties and municipalities that have an established residential, including multifamily, or commercial recycling program that provides recycling receptacles to residences and businesses and regular pickup services for those receptacles.

(d) If, by January 1 of 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, or 2021, the county, as determined by the department in accordance with applicable rules, has not reached the recycling goals as set forth in paragraph (a), the department may direct the county to develop a plan to expand recycling programs to existing commercial and multifamily dwellings, including, but not limited to, apartment complexes.

(e) If the state’s recycling rate for the 2013 calendar year is below 40 percent; below 50 percent by January 1, 2015; below 60 percent by January 1, 2017; below 70 percent by January 1, 2019; or below 75 percent by January 1, 2021, the department shall provide a report to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The report shall identify those additional programs or statutory changes needed to achieve the goals set forth in paragraph (a). The report shall be provided no later than 30 days prior to the beginning of the regular session of the Legislature. The department is not required to provide a report to the Legislature if the state reaches its recycling goals as described in this paragraph.

(f) Such programs shall be designed to recover a significant portion of at least four of the following materials from the solid waste stream prior to final disposal at a solid waste disposal facility and to offer these materials for recycling: newspaper, aluminum cans, steel cans, glass, plastic bottles, cardboard, office paper, and yard trash. Local governments which operate permitted waste-to-energy facilities may retrieve ferrous and nonferrous metal as a byproduct of combustion.

(g) Local governments are encouraged to separate all plastics, metal, and all grades of paper for recycling prior to final disposal and are further encouraged to recycle yard trash and other mechanically treated solid waste into compost available for agricultural and other acceptable uses.

(h) The department shall adopt rules establishing the method and criteria to be used by a county in calculating the recycling rates pursuant to this subsection.

(i) Each county is encouraged to consider plans for composting or mulching organic materials that would otherwise be disposed of in a landfill. The composting or mulching plans are encouraged to address partnership with the private sector.

(4)(a) In order to promote the production of renewable energy from solid waste, each megawatt-hour produced by a renewable energy facility using solid waste as a fuel shall count as 1 ton of recycled material and shall be applied toward meeting the recycling goals set forth in this section. If a county creating renewable energy from solid waste implements and maintains a program to recycle at least 50 percent of municipal solid waste by a means other than creating renewable energy, that county shall count 1.25 tons of recycled material for each megawatt-hour produced. If waste originates from a county other than the county in which the renewable energy facility resides, the originating county shall receive such recycling credit. Any byproduct resulting from the creation of renewable energy that is recycled shall count towards the county recycling goals in accordance with the methods and criteria developed pursuant to paragraph (2)(h).

(b) A county may receive credit for one-half of the recycling goal set forth in subsection (2) from the use of yard trash, or other clean wood waste or paper waste, in innovative programs including, but not limited to, programs that produce alternative clean-burning fuels such as ethanol or that provide for the conversion of yard trash or other clean wood waste or paper waste to clean-burning fuel for the production of energy for use at facilities other than a waste-to-energy facility as defined in s. 403.7061. The provisions of this paragraph apply only if a county can demonstrate that:1. The county has implemented a yard trash mulching or composting program, and2. As part of the program, compost and mulch made from yard trash is available to the general public and in use at county-owned or maintained and municipally owned or maintained facilities in the county and state agencies operating in the county as required by this section.

(c) A county with a population of 100,000 or less may provide its residents with the opportunity to recycle in lieu of achieving the goal set forth in this section. For the purposes of this section, the “opportunity to recycle” means that the county:1.a. Provides a system for separating and collecting recyclable materials prior to disposal that is located at a solid waste management facility or solid waste disposal area; orb. Provides a system of places within the county for collection of source-separated recyclable materials.2. Provides a public education and promotion program that is conducted to inform its residents of the opportunity to recycle, encourages source separation of recyclable materials, and promotes the benefits of reducing, reusing, recycling, and composting materials.

(a) The achievement of the goal set forth in subsection (2) would have an adverse effect on the financial obligations of a county that are directly related to a waste-to-energy facility owned or operated by or on behalf of the county; and

(b) The county cannot remove normally combustible materials from solid waste that is to be processed at a waste-to-energy facility because of the need to maintain a sufficient amount of solid waste to ensure the financial viability of the facility.

(a) The information submitted to the department by the county must, at a minimum, include:1. The amount of municipal solid waste disposed of at solid waste disposal facilities, by type of waste such as yard trash, white goods, clean debris, tires, and unseparated solid waste;2. The amount and type of materials from the municipal solid waste stream that were recycled; and3. The percentage of the population participating in various types of recycling activities instituted.

(b) Beginning with the data for the 2012 calendar year, the department shall by July 1 each year post on its website the recycling rates of each county for the prior calendar year.

(a) To contract with persons to provide resource recovery services or operate resource recovery facilities on behalf of the county or municipality.

(b) To indemnify persons providing resource recovery services or operating resource recovery facilities for liabilities or claims arising out of the provision or operation of such services or facilities that are not the result of the sole negligence of the persons providing such services or operating such facilities.

(c) To waive sovereign immunity and immunity from suit in federal court by vote of the governing body of the county or municipality to the extent necessary to carry out the authority granted in paragraphs (a) and (b), notwithstanding the limitations prescribed in s. 768.28.

(d) To grant a solid waste fee waiver to nonprofit organizations that are engaged in the collection of donated goods for charitable purposes and that have a recycling or reuse rate of 50 percent or better.

(22)(a) Each contract between a residential recycling collector and a county or municipality for the collection or transport of residential recyclable material, and each request for proposal or other solicitation for the collection of residential recyclable material, must include all of the following:1. The respective strategies and obligations of the county or municipality and the residential recycling collector to reduce the amount of contaminated recyclable material being collected.2. The procedures for identifying, documenting, managing, and rejecting residential recycling containers, truck loads, carts, or bins that contain contaminated recyclable material.3. The remedies authorized to be used if a container, cart, or bin contains contaminated recyclable material.4. The education and enforcement measures that will be used to reduce the amount of contaminated recyclable material.5. A definition of the term “contaminated recyclable material” that is appropriate for the local community.

(b) Each contract between a recovered materials processing facility and a county or municipality for processing residential recyclable material, and each request for proposal or other solicitation for processing residential recyclable material, must include all of the following:1. The respective strategies and obligations of the county or municipality and the facility to reduce the amount of contaminated recyclable material being collected and processed.2. The procedures for identifying, documenting, managing, and rejecting residential recycling containers, truck loads, carts, or bins that contain contaminated recyclable material.3. The remedies authorized to be used if a container or truck load contains contaminated recyclable material.4. A definition of the term “contaminated recyclable material” that is appropriate for the local community.

(c) After a contract is executed, a residential recycling collector is not required to collect or transport contaminated recyclable material, except pursuant to a contract consistent with paragraph (a).

"(a) Disposal by persons of solid waste resulting from their own activities on their own property, if such waste is ordinary household waste from their residential property or is rocks, soils, trees, tree remains, and other vegetative matter that normally result from land development operations. Disposal of materials that could create a public nuisance or adversely affect the environment or public health, such as white goods; automotive materials, such as batteries and tires; petroleum products; pesticides; solvents; or hazardous substances, is not covered under this exemption.

(b) Storage in containers by persons of solid waste resulting from their own activities on their property, leased or rented property, or property subject to a homeowners’ or maintenance association for which the person contributes association assessments, if the solid waste in such containers is collected at least once a week.

(c) Disposal by persons of solid waste resulting from their own activities on their property, if the environmental effects of such disposal on groundwater and surface waters are:1. Addressed or authorized by a site certification order issued under part II or a permit issued by the department under this chapter or rules adopted pursuant to this chapter; or2. Addressed or authorized by, or exempted from the requirement to obtain, a groundwater monitoring plan approved by the department. If a facility has a permit authorizing disposal activity, new areas where solid waste is being disposed of which are monitored by an existing or modified groundwater monitoring plan are not required to be specifically authorized in a permit or other certification.

(d) Disposal by persons of solid waste resulting from their own activities on their own property, if such disposal occurred prior to October 1, 1988.

(e) Disposal of solid waste resulting from normal farming operations as defined by department rule. Polyethylene agricultural plastic, damaged, nonsalvageable, untreated wood pallets, and packing material that cannot be feasibly recycled, which are used in connection with agricultural operations related to the growing, harvesting, or maintenance of crops, may be disposed of by open burning if a public nuisance or any condition adversely affecting the environment or the public health is not created by the open burning and state or federal ambient air quality standards are not violated.

(f) The use of clean debris as fill material in any area. However, this paragraph does not exempt any person from obtaining any other required permits, and does not affect a person’s responsibility to dispose of clean debris appropriately if it is not to be used as fill material.

(g) Compost operations that produce less than 50 cubic yards of compost per year when the compost produced is used on the property where the compost operation is located.

(3)(a) All applicable provisions of ss. 403.087 and 403.088, relating to permits, apply to the control of solid waste management facilities.

(b) A permit, including a general permit, issued to a solid waste management facility that is designed with a leachate control system meeting department requirements shall be issued for a term of 20 years unless the applicant requests a shorter permit term. This paragraph applies to a qualifying solid waste management facility that applies for an operating or construction permit or renews an existing operating or construction permit on or after October 1, 2012.

(c) A permit, including a general permit, but not including a registration, issued to a solid waste management facility that does not have a leachate control system meeting department requirements shall be renewed for a term of 10 years, unless the applicant requests a shorter permit term, if the following conditions are met:1. The applicant has conducted the regulated activity at the same site for which the renewal is sought for at least 4 years and 6 months before the date that the permit application is received by the department; and2. At the time of applying for the renewal permit:a. The applicant is not subject to a notice of violation, consent order, or administrative order issued by the department for violation of an applicable law or rule;b. The department has not notified the applicant that it is required to implement assessment or evaluation monitoring as a result of exceedances of applicable groundwater standards or criteria or, if applicable, the applicant is completing corrective actions in accordance with applicable department rules; andc. The applicant is in compliance with the applicable financial assurance requirements.

(d) The department may adopt rules to administer this subsection. However, the department is not required to submit such rules to the Environmental Regulation Commission for approval. Notwithstanding the limitations of s. 403.087(7)(a), permit fee caps for solid waste management facilities shall be prorated to reflect the extended permit term authorized by this subsection.

(a) Use natural or artificial barriers that are capable of controlling lateral or vertical movement of wastes or waste constituents into surface or ground waters.

(b) Have a foundation or base that is capable of providing support for structures and waste deposits and capable of preventing foundation or base failure due to settlement, compression, or uplift.

(c) Provide for the most economically feasible, cost-effective, and environmentally safe control of leachate, gas, stormwater, and disease vectors and prevent the endangerment of public health and the environment.

(a) The department shall establish reasonable construction, operation, monitoring, recordkeeping, financial assurance, and closure requirements for such facilities. The department shall take into account the nature of the waste accepted at various facilities when establishing these requirements, and may impose less stringent requirements, including a system of general permits or registration requirements, for facilities that accept only a segregated waste stream which is expected to pose a minimal risk to the environment and public health, such as clean debris. The Legislature recognizes that incidental amounts of other types of solid waste are commonly generated at construction or demolition projects. In any enforcement action taken pursuant to this section, the department shall consider the difficulty of removing these incidental amounts from the waste stream.

(b) The department shall require liners and leachate collection systems at individual disposal units and lateral expansions of existing disposal units that have not received a department permit authorizing construction or operation prior to July 1, 2010, unless the owner or operator demonstrates, based upon the types of waste received, the methods for controlling types of waste disposed of, the proximity of the groundwater and surface water, and the results of the hydrogeological and geotechnical investigations, that the facility is not expected to result in violations of the groundwater standards and criteria if built without a liner.

(c) The owner or operator shall provide financial assurance for closing of the facility in accordance with the requirements of s. 403.7125. The financial assurance shall cover the cost of closing the facility and 5 years of long-term care after closing, unless the department determines, based upon hydrogeologic conditions, the types of wastes received, or the groundwater monitoring results, that a different long-term care period is appropriate. However, unless the owner or operator of the facility is a local government, the escrow account described in s. 403.7125(2) may not be used as a financial assurance mechanism.

(d) The department shall establish training requirements for operators of facilities, and shall work with the State University System or other providers to assure that adequate training courses are available. The department shall also assist the Florida Home Builders Association in establishing a component of its continuing education program to address proper handling of construction and demolition debris, including best management practices for reducing contamination of the construction and demolition debris waste stream.

(e) The issuance of a permit under this subsection does not obviate the need to comply with all applicable zoning and land use regulations.

(f) A permit is not required under this section for the disposal of construction and demolition debris on the property where it is generated, but such property must be covered, graded, and vegetated as necessary when disposal is complete.

(g) By January 1, 2012, the amount of construction and demolition debris processed and recycled prior to disposal at a permitted materials recovery facility or at any other permitted disposal facility shall be reported by the county of origin to the department and to the county on an annual basis in accordance with rules adopted by the department. The rules shall establish criteria to ensure accurate and consistent reporting for purposes of determining the recycling rate in s. 403.706 and shall also require that, to the extent economically feasible, all construction and demolition debris must be processed prior to disposal, either at a permitted materials recovery facility or at a permitted disposal facility. This paragraph does not apply to recovered materials, any materials that have been source separated and offered for recycling, or materials that have been previously processed.

(h) The department shall ensure that the requirements of this section are applied and interpreted consistently throughout the state. In accordance with s. 20.255, the Division of Waste Management shall direct the district offices and bureaus on matters relating to the interpretation and applicability of this section.

(i) The department shall provide notice of receipt of a permit application for the initial construction of a construction and demolition debris disposal facility to the local governments having jurisdiction where the facility is to be located.

(j) The Legislature recognizes that recycling, waste reduction, and resource recovery are important aspects of an integrated solid waste management program and as such are necessary to protect the public health and the environment. If necessary to promote such an integrated program, the county may determine, after providing notice and an opportunity for a hearing prior to April 30, 2008, that some or all of the material described in s. 403.703(6)(b) shall be excluded from the definition of “construction and demolition debris” in s. 403.703(6) within the jurisdiction of such county. The county may make such a determination only if it finds that, prior to June 1, 2007, the county has established an adequate method for the use or recycling of such wood material at an existing or proposed solid waste management facility that is permitted or authorized by the department on June 1, 2007. The county is not required to hold a hearing if the county represents that it previously has held a hearing for such purpose, or if the county represents that it previously has held a public meeting or hearing that authorized such method for the use or recycling of trash or other nonputrescible waste materials and that such materials include those materials described in s. 403.703(6)(b). The county shall provide written notice of its determination to the department by no later than April 30, 2008; thereafter, the materials described in s. 403.703(6) shall be excluded from the definition of “construction and demolition debris” in s. 403.703(6) within the jurisdiction of such county. The county may withdraw or revoke its determination at any time by providing written notice to the department.

(k) Brazilian pepper and other invasive exotic plant species as designated by the department resulting from eradication projects may be processed at permitted construction and demolition debris recycling facilities or disposed of at permitted construction and demolition debris disposal facilities or Class III facilities. The department may adopt rules to implement this paragraph.

(14)(a) A permit to operate a solid waste management facility may not be transferred by the permittee to any other entity without the consent of the department. If the permitted facility is sold or transferred, or if control of the facility is transferred, the permittee must submit to the department an application for transfer of permit no later than 30 days after the transfer of ownership or control. The department shall approve the transfer of a permit unless it determines that the proposed new permittee has not provided reasonable assurance that the conditions of the permit will be met. A permit may not be transferred until any proof of financial assurance required by department rule is provided by the proposed new permittee. If the existing permittee is under a continuing obligation to perform corrective actions as a result of a department enforcement action or consent order, the permit may not be transferred until the proposed new permittee agrees in writing to accept responsibility for performing such corrective actions.

(b) Until the transfer is approved by the department, the existing permittee is liable for compliance with the permit, including the financial assurance requirements. When the transfer has been approved, the department shall return to the transferring permittee any means of proof of financial assurance which the permittee provided to the department and the permittee is released from obligations to comply with the transferred permit.

(c) An application for the transfer of a permit must clearly state in bold letters that the permit may not be transferred without proof of compliance with financial assurance requirements. Until the permit is transferred, the new owner or operator may not operate the facility without the express consent of the permittee.

(d) The department may adopt rules to administer this subsection, including procedural rules and the permit transfer form.

(c)1. Yard trash in lined landfills classified by department rule as Class I landfills, unless the Class I landfill uses an active gas-collection system to collect landfill gas generated at the disposal facility and provides or arranges for a beneficial use of the gas. A Class I landfill may also accept yard trash for the purpose of mulching and using the yard trash to provide landfill cover for municipal solid waste disposed at the landfill. The department shall, by rule, develop and adopt a methodology to award recycling credit for the use or disposal of yard trash at a Class I landfill having a gas-collection system that makes beneficial use of the collected landfill gas. A qualifying permitted Class I landfill must obtain a minor permit modification to its operating permit which describes the beneficial use being made of the landfill gas and modifies the facility’s operation plan before receiving yard trash as authorized under this subparagraph. The permittee must certify that gas collection and beneficial use will continue after closure of the disposal facility that is accepting yard trash. If the landfill is located in a county that owns and operates a compost facility, waste-to-energy facility, or biomass facility that sells renewable energy to a public utility and that is authorized to accept yard trash, the department shall provide the county with notice of, and opportunity to comment on, the application for permit modification.2. Yard trash that is source separated from solid waste may be accepted at a solid waste disposal area if separate yard trash composting facilities are provided and maintained. The department recognizes that incidental amounts of yard trash may be disposed of in Class I landfills. In any enforcement action taken pursuant to this paragraph, the department shall consider the difficulty of removing incidental amounts of yard trash from a mixed solid waste stream. This limited exception applies in all units of local government, including, but not limited to, municipalities, counties, and special districts. However, the exception does not apply to a county that currently operates under a constitutional home rule charter authorized in 1956 in a statewide referendum. The limited exception to the ban on disposing of yard trash in a Class I landfill is not intended to have a material impact on current operations at existing waste-to-energy or biomass facilities.

"(a) If the employer is not a certificateholder or registrant in that type of contracting, and the employee performs any of the following, the employee is not exempt:1. Holds himself or herself or his or her employer out to be licensed or qualified by a licensee;2. Leads the consumer to believe that the employee has an ownership or management interest in the company; or3. Performs any of the acts which constitute contracting.

(b) The legislative intent of this subsection is to place equal responsibility on the unlicensed business and its employees for the protection of the consumers in contracting transactions.

(7)(a) Owners of property when acting as their own contractor and providing direct, onsite supervision themselves of all work not performed by licensed contractors:1. When building or improving farm outbuildings or one-family or two-family residences on such property for the occupancy or use of such owners and not offered for sale or lease, or building or improving commercial buildings, at a cost not to exceed $75,000, on such property for the occupancy or use of such owners and not offered for sale or lease. In an action brought under this part, proof of the sale or lease, or offering for sale or lease, of any such structure by the owner-builder within 1 year after completion of same creates a presumption that the construction was undertaken for purposes of sale or lease.2. When repairing or replacing wood shakes or asphalt or fiberglass shingles on one-family, two-family, or three-family residences for the occupancy or use of such owner or tenant of the owner and not offered for sale within 1 year after completion of the work and when the property has been damaged by natural causes from an event recognized as an emergency situation designated by executive order issued by the Governor declaring the existence of a state of emergency as a result and consequence of a serious threat posed to the public health, safety, and property in this state.3. When installing, uninstalling, or replacing solar panels on one-family, two-family, or three-family residences, and the local permitting agency’s county or municipal government is participating in a “United States Department of Energy SunShot Initiative: Rooftop Solar Challenge” grant. However, an owner must utilize a licensed electrical contractor to effectuate the wiring of the solar panels, including any interconnection to the customer’s residential electrical wiring. The limitations of this exemption shall be expressly stated in the building permit approved and issued by the permitting agency for such project.4. When completing the requirements of a building permit, where the contractor listed on the permit substantially completed the project as determined by the local permitting agency, for a one-family or two-family residence, townhome, or an accessory structure of a one-family or two-family residence or townhome or an individual residential condominium unit or cooperative unit. Prior to qualifying for the exemption, the owner must receive approval from the local permitting agency, and the local permitting agency must determine that the contractor listed on the permit substantially completed the project. An owner who qualifies for the exemption under this subparagraph is not required to occupy the dwelling or unit for at least 1 year after the completion of the project.

(b) This subsection does not exempt any person who is employed by or has a contract with such owner and who acts in the capacity of a contractor. The owner may not delegate the owner’s responsibility to directly supervise all work to any other person unless that person is registered or certified under this part and the work being performed is within the scope of that person’s license. For the purposes of this subsection, the term “owners of property” includes the owner of a mobile home situated on a leased lot.

(c) To qualify for exemption under this subsection, an owner must personally appear and sign the building permit application and must satisfy local permitting agency requirements, if any, proving that the owner has a complete understanding of the owner’s obligations under the law as specified in the disclosure statement in this section. However, for purposes of implementing a “United States Department of Energy SunShot Initiative: Rooftop Solar Challenge” grant and the participation of county and municipal governments, including local permitting agencies under the jurisdiction of such county and municipal governments, an owner’s notarized signature or personal appearance to sign the permit application is not required for a solar project, as described in subparagraph (a)3., if the building permit application is submitted electronically to the permitting agency and the owner certifies the application and disclosure statement using the permitting agency’s electronic confirmation system. If any person violates the requirements of this subsection, the local permitting agency shall withhold final approval, revoke the permit, or pursue any action or remedy for unlicensed activity against the owner and any person performing work that requires licensure under the permit issued. The local permitting agency shall provide the person with a disclosure statement in substantially the following form:DISCLOSURE STATEMENT1. I understand that state law requires construction to be done by a licensed contractor and have applied for an owner-builder permit under an exemption from the law. The exemption specifies that I, as the owner of the property listed, may act as my own contractor with certain restrictions even though I do not have a license.2. I understand that building permits are not required to be signed by a property owner unless he or she is responsible for the construction and is not hiring a licensed contractor to assume responsibility.3. I understand that, as an owner-builder, I am the responsible party of record on a permit. I understand that I may protect myself from potential financial risk by hiring a licensed contractor and having the permit filed in his or her name instead of my own name. I also understand that a contractor is required by law to be licensed in Florida and to list his or her license numbers on permits and contracts.4. I understand that I may build or improve a one-family or two-family residence or a farm outbuilding. I may also build or improve a commercial building if the costs do not exceed $75,000. The building or residence must be for my own use or occupancy. It may not be built or substantially improved for sale or lease, unless I am completing the requirements of a building permit where the contractor listed on the permit substantially completed the project. If a building or residence that I have built or substantially improved myself is sold or leased within 1 year after the construction is complete, the law will presume that I built or substantially improved it for sale or lease, which violates the exemption.5. I understand that, as the owner-builder, I must provide direct, onsite supervision of the construction.6. I understand that I may not hire an unlicensed person to act as my contractor or to supervise persons working on my building or residence. It is my responsibility to ensure that the persons whom I employ have the licenses required by law and by county or municipal ordinance.7. I understand that it is a frequent practice of unlicensed persons to have the property owner obtain an owner-builder permit that erroneously implies that the property owner is providing his or her own labor and materials. I, as an owner-builder, may be held liable and subjected to serious financial risk for any injuries sustained by an unlicensed person or his or her employees while working on my property. My homeowner’s insurance may not provide coverage for those injuries. I am willfully acting as an owner-builder and am aware of the limits of my insurance coverage for injuries to workers on my property.8. I understand that I may not delegate the responsibility for supervising work to a licensed contractor who is not licensed to perform the work being done. Any person working on my building who is not licensed must work under my direct supervision and must be employed by me, which means that I must comply with laws requiring the withholding of federal income tax and social security contributions under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and must provide workers’ compensation for the employee. I understand that my failure to follow these laws may subject me to serious financial risk.9. I agree that, as the party legally and financially responsible for this proposed construction activity, I will abide by all applicable laws and requirements that govern owner-builders as well as employers. I also understand that the construction must comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, building codes, and zoning regulations.10. I understand that I may obtain more information regarding my obligations as an employer from the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Small Business Administration, the Florida Department of Financial Services, and the Florida Department of Revenue. I also understand that I may contact the Florida Construction Industry Licensing Board at   (telephone number)   or   (Internet website address)   for more information about licensed contractors.11. I am aware of, and consent to, an owner-builder building permit applied for in my name and understand that I am the party legally and financially responsible for the proposed construction activity at the following address:   (address of property)  .12. I agree to notify   (issuer of disclosure statements)   immediately of any additions, deletions, or changes to any of the information that I have provided on this disclosure.Licensed contractors are regulated by laws designed to protect the public. If you contract with a person who does not have a license, the Construction Industry Licensing Board and Department of Business and Professional Regulation may be unable to assist you with any financial loss that you sustain as a result of a complaint. Your only remedy against an unlicensed contractor may be in civil court. It is also important for you to understand that, if an unlicensed contractor or employee of an individual or firm is injured while working on your property, you may be held liable for damages. If you obtain an owner-builder permit and wish to hire a licensed contractor, you will be responsible for verifying whether the contractor is properly licensed and the status of the contractor’s workers’ compensation coverage.Before a building permit can be issued, this disclosure statement must be completed and signed by the property owner and returned to the local permitting agency responsible for issuing the permit. A copy of the property owner’s driver license, the notarized signature of the property owner, or other type of verification acceptable to the local permitting agency is required when the permit is issued.Signature:   (signature of property owner)  .Date:   (date)  .

(d) A building permit application and disclosure statement electronically submitted by an owner to the authority for a solar project, as described in subparagraph (a)3., must also contain the following additional statement:OWNER’S ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION STATEMENT: Under penalty of perjury, I declare that all the information contained in this building permit application and the representations made in the required disclosure statement are true and correct.

(e) A permitting authority that accepts a building permit application and disclosure statement in an electronic format from an owner who is exempt pursuant to this subsection and who applies for a permit relating to a solar project, as described in subparagraph (a)3., is not liable in any civil action for inaccurate information submitted by the owner using the authority’s electronic confirmation system.

(a) If the construction, repair, remodeling, or improvement is a part of a larger or major operation, whether undertaken by the same or a different contractor, or in which a division of the operation is made in contracts of amounts less than $2,500 for the purpose of evading this part or otherwise.

(b) To a person who advertises that he or she is a contractor or otherwise represents that he or she is qualified to engage in contracting.

(10)(a) Any construction or operation incidental to the construction or repair of irrigation and drainage ditches;

(b) Regularly constituted irrigation districts or reclamation districts; or

(c) Clearing or other work on the land in rural districts for fire prevention purposes or otherwise except when performed by a licensee.

(a) If the maintenance, repair, remodeling, or improvement is a part of a larger or major operation, whether undertaken by the same or a different contractor, or in which a division of the operation is made in contracts of amounts less than $5,000 for the purpose of evading this part or otherwise.

(b) To a person who advertises that he or she is qualified to engage in contracting.

"(a) The department shall issue a cease and desist order to prohibit any person from engaging in the business of contracting who does not hold the required certification or registration for the work being performed under this part. For the purpose of enforcing a cease and desist order, the department may file a proceeding in the name of the state seeking issuance of an injunction or a writ of mandamus against any person who violates any provision of such order.

(b) A county, municipality, or local licensing board created by special act may issue a cease and desist order to prohibit any person from engaging in the business of contracting who does not hold the required certification or registration for the work being performed under this part.

(a) A general, building, or residential contractor, except as otherwise provided in this part, shall be responsible for any construction or alteration of a structural component of a building or structure, and any certified general contractor or certified underground utility and excavation contractor may perform clearing and grubbing, grading, excavation, and other site work for any construction project in the state. Any certified building contractor or certified residential contractor may perform clearing and grubbing, grading, excavation, and other site work for any construction project in this state, limited to the lot on which any specific building is located.

(b) A general, building, or residential contractor shall not be required to subcontract the installation, or repair made under warranty, of wood shingles, wood shakes, or asphalt or fiberglass shingle roofing materials on a new building of his or her own construction.

(c) A general contractor shall not be required to subcontract structural swimming pool work. All other swimming pool work shall be subcontracted to an appropriately licensed certified or registered swimming pool contractor.

(d) A general contractor shall not be required to subcontract the construction of a main sanitary sewer collection system, storm collection system, or water distribution system, not including the continuation of utility lines from the mains to the buildings, and may perform any of the services, on public or private property, for which a license as an underground utility and excavation contractor is required under this part.

(e) A general contractor shall not be required to subcontract the continuation of utility lines from the mains in mobile home parks, and such continuations are to be considered a part of the main sewer collection and main water distribution systems.

(f) A solar contractor shall not be required to subcontract minor, as defined by board rule, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, or roofing work so long as that work is within the scope of the license held by the solar contractor and where such work exclusively pertains to the installation of residential solar energy equipment as defined by rules of the board adopted in conjunction with the Electrical Contracting Licensing Board.

(g) No general, building, or residential contractor certified after 1973 shall act as, hold himself or herself out to be, or advertise himself or herself to be a roofing contractor unless he or she is certified or registered as a roofing contractor.

(4)(a) When a certificateholder desires to engage in contracting in any area of the state, as a prerequisite therefor, he or she shall be required only to exhibit to the local building official, tax collector, or other person in charge of the issuance of licenses and building permits in the area evidence of holding a current certificate and to pay the fee for the occupational license and building permit required of other persons.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), a local construction regulation board may deny, suspend, or revoke the authority of a certified contractor to obtain a building permit or limit such authority to obtaining a permit or permits with specific conditions, if the local construction regulation board has found such contractor, through the public hearing process, to be guilty of fraud or a willful building code violation within the county or municipality that the local construction regulation board represents or if the local construction regulation board has proof that such contractor, through the public hearing process, has been found guilty in another county or municipality within the past 12 months, of fraud or a willful building code violation and finds, after providing notice of an opportunity to be heard to the contractor, that such fraud or violation would have been fraud or a violation if committed in the county or municipality that the local construction board represents. Notification of and information concerning such permit denial shall be submitted to the department within 15 days after the local construction regulation board decides to deny the permit.

(c) The local government may also deny issuance of, or may suspend, any outstanding building permit where a contractor fails or refuses to provide proof of public liability and property damage insurance coverage as required by s. 489.115(5) and workers’ compensation insurance coverage as required by s. 489.114.

(d) It is the policy of the state that the purpose of regulation is to protect the public by attaining compliance with the policies established in law. Fines and other penalties are provided in order to ensure compliance; however, the collection of fines and the imposition of penalties are intended to be secondary to the primary goal of attaining compliance with state laws and local jurisdiction ordinances. It is the intent of the Legislature that a local jurisdiction agency charged with enforcing regulatory laws shall issue a notice of noncompliance as its first response to a minor violation of a regulatory law in any instance in which it is reasonable to assume that the violator was unaware of such a law or unclear as to how to comply with it. A violation of a regulatory law is a “minor violation” if it does not result in economic or physical harm to a person or adversely affect the public health, safety, or welfare or create a significant threat of such harm. A “notice of noncompliance” is a notification by the local jurisdiction agency charged with enforcing the ordinance, which is issued to the licensee that is subject to the ordinance. A notice of noncompliance should not be accompanied with a fine or other disciplinary penalty. It should identify the specific ordinance that is being violated, provide information on how to comply with the ordinance, and specify a reasonable time for the violator to comply with the ordinance. Failure of a licensee to take action correcting the violation within a set period of time would then result in the institution of further disciplinary proceedings.

(6)(a) The board shall, by rule, designate those types of specialty contractors which may be certified under this part. The limit of the scope of work and responsibility of a specialty contractor shall be established by the board by rule. However, a certified specialty contractor category established by board rule exists as a voluntary statewide licensing category and does not create a mandatory licensing requirement. Any mandatory statewide construction contracting licensure requirement may only be established through specific statutory provision.

(b) By July 1, 2025, the board shall, by rule, establish certified specialty contractor categories for voluntary licensure for all of the following:1. Structural aluminum or screen enclosures.2. Marine seawall work.3. Marine bulkhead work.4. Marine dock work.5. Marine pile driving.6. Structural masonry.7. Structural prestressed, precast concrete work.8. Rooftop solar heating installation.9. Structural steel.10. Window and door installation, including garage door installation and hurricane or windstorm protection.11. Plaster and lath.12. Structural carpentry.

(a) The applicant documents 10 years of experience in the appropriate construction craft.

(b) The applicant files written recommendations concerning his or her competency in the appropriate construction craft.

(c) The applicant is administered only one oral examination within a period of 1 year.

(9)(a) This part does not prevent any contractor from acting as a prime contractor where the majority of the work to be performed under the contract is within the scope of his or her license or from subcontracting to other licensed contractors that remaining work which is part of the project contracted.

(b) This part, chapter 471, chapter 481, or any other provision of law does not:1. Prevent any licensed engineer or architect from contracting directly with a licensed contractor for the preparation of plans, specifications, or a master design manual addressing structural designs used to make an application for building permits.2. Require a licensed engineer or architect, when preparing drawings, specifications, plans, or master design manuals for use by any licensed contractor, to prepare site-specific drawings, specifications, or plans for the design and construction of single-family and two-family dwellings; swimming pools, spas, or screened enclosures; or any other structure not exceeding 1,200 square feet or one story in height. For the purpose of issuing building permits, local building officials shall accept such drawings, specifications, or plans when submitted by any licensed contractor. Upon good cause shown, local government code enforcement agencies may accept or reject plans prepared by persons licensed under chapter 471, chapter 481, or this chapter.As used in this section, the term “master design manual” means a restrictive design manual intended to be used to design, permit, and construct structures as described in this section. Any such manual must be prepared by a licensed engineer or architect and specifically detail the limits of its use, including, but not limited to, the structure type, size, materials, loading conditions, time limits, applicable codes, and associated criteria. The manual must also detail the required training for the contractor, engineer, or architect using the manual. All master design manuals must be peer reviewed by an independent licensed engineer or architect having no financial interest in the development of the manual or the construction of structures pursuant to the manual. The engineer or architect conducting the peer review must be identified in the manual.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this chapter or any other provision of law, a licensed engineer or architect is not required for the preparation or use of any design guide adopted by the Florida Building Commission as part of the building code pursuant to s. 553.73.

(b) The technical portions of the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction shall be contained in their entirety in the Florida Building Code. The civil rights portions and the technical portions of the accessibility laws of this state shall remain as currently provided by law. Any revision or amendments to the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction pursuant to part II shall be considered adopted by the commission as part of the Florida Building Code. Neither the commission nor any local government shall revise or amend any standard of the Florida Accessibility Code for Building Construction except as provided for in part II.

(c) The Florida Fire Prevention Code and the Life Safety Code shall be referenced in the Florida Building Code, but shall be adopted, modified, revised, or amended, interpreted, and maintained by the Department of Financial Services by rule adopted pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54. The Florida Building Commission may not adopt a fire prevention or lifesafety code, and nothing in the Florida Building Code shall affect the statutory powers, duties, and responsibilities of any fire official or the Department of Financial Services.

(d) Conflicting requirements between the Florida Building Code and the Florida Fire Prevention Code and Life Safety Code of the state established pursuant to ss. 633.206 and 633.208 shall be resolved by agreement between the commission and the State Fire Marshal in favor of the requirement that offers the greatest degree of lifesafety or alternatives that would provide an equivalent degree of lifesafety and an equivalent method of construction. If the commission and State Fire Marshal are unable to agree on a resolution, the question shall be referred to a mediator, mutually agreeable to both parties, to resolve the conflict in favor of the provision that offers the greatest lifesafety, or alternatives that would provide an equivalent degree of lifesafety and an equivalent method of construction.

(e) Subject to the provisions of this act, responsibility for enforcement, interpretation, and regulation of the Florida Building Code shall be vested in a specified local board or agency, and the words “local government” and “local governing body” as used in this part shall be construed to refer exclusively to such local board or agency.

(a) The proposed amendment must have been published on the commission’s website for a minimum of 45 days and all the associated documentation must have been made available to any interested party before consideration by a technical advisory committee.

(4)(a) All entities authorized to enforce the Florida Building Code under s. 553.80 shall comply with applicable standards for issuance of mandatory certificates of occupancy, minimum types of inspections, and procedures for plans review and inspections as established by the commission by rule. Local governments may adopt amendments to the administrative provisions of the Florida Building Code, subject to the limitations in this subsection. Local amendments must be more stringent than the minimum standards described in this section and must be transmitted to the commission within 30 days after enactment. The local government shall make such amendments available to the general public in a usable format. The State Fire Marshal is responsible for establishing the standards and procedures required in this subsection for governmental entities with respect to applying the Florida Fire Prevention Code and the Life Safety Code.

(b) Local governments may, subject to the limitations in this section and not more than once every 6 months, adopt amendments to the technical provisions of the Florida Building Code that apply solely within the jurisdiction of such government and that provide for more stringent requirements than those specified in the Florida Building Code. A local government may adopt technical amendments that address local needs if:1. The local governing body determines, following a public hearing which has been advertised in a newspaper of general circulation at least 10 days before the hearing, that there is a need to strengthen the requirements of the Florida Building Code. The determination must be based upon a review of local conditions by the local governing body, which review demonstrates by evidence or data that the geographical jurisdiction governed by the local governing body exhibits a local need to strengthen the Florida Building Code beyond the needs or regional variation addressed by the Florida Building Code, that the local need is addressed by the proposed local amendment, and that the amendment is no more stringent than necessary to address the local need.2. Such additional requirements are not discriminatory against materials, products, or construction techniques of demonstrated capabilities.3. Such additional requirements may not introduce a new subject not addressed in the Florida Building Code.

At such time, the commission shall review such amendment for consistency with the criteria in paragraph (9)(a) and adopt such amendment as part of the Florida Building Code or rescind the amendment. The commission shall immediately notify the respective local government of the rescission of any amendment. After receiving such notice, the respective local government may readopt the rescinded amendment under the provisions of this subsection.

(f) Each county and municipality desiring to make local technical amendments to the Florida Building Code shall establish by interlocal agreement a countywide compliance review board to review any amendment to the Florida Building Code that is adopted by a local government within the county under this subsection and that is challenged by a substantially affected party for purposes of determining the amendment’s compliance with this subsection. If challenged, the local technical amendments are not effective until the time for filing an appeal under paragraph (g) has expired or, if there is an appeal, until the commission issues its final order determining if the adopted amendment is in compliance with this subsection.

(g) If the compliance review board determines such amendment is not in compliance with this subsection, the compliance review board shall notify such local government of the noncompliance and that the amendment is invalid and unenforceable until the local government corrects the amendment to bring it into compliance. The local government may appeal the decision of the compliance review board to the commission. If the compliance review board determines that such amendment is in compliance with this subsection, any substantially affected party may appeal such determination to the commission. Any such appeal must be filed with the commission within 14 days after the board’s written determination.

The compliance review board shall determine whether its decisions apply to a respective local jurisdiction or apply countywide.

(h) An amendment adopted under this subsection must include a fiscal impact statement that documents the costs and benefits of the proposed amendment. Criteria for the fiscal impact statement shall include the impact to local government relative to enforcement and the impact to property and building owners and industry relative to the cost of compliance.

(j) Any amendment adopted by a local enforcing agency under this subsection may not apply to state or school district owned buildings, manufactured buildings or factory-built school buildings approved by the commission, or prototype buildings approved under s. 553.77(3). The respective responsible entities shall consider the physical performance parameters substantiating such amendments when designing, specifying, and constructing such exempt buildings.

(k) A technical amendment to the Florida Building Code related to water conservation practices or design criteria adopted by a local government under this subsection is not void when the code is updated if the technical amendment is necessary to protect or provide for more efficient use of water resources as provided in s. 373.621. However, any such technical amendment carried forward into the next edition of the code under this paragraph is subject to review or modification as provided in this part.

(l) If a local government adopts a regulation, law, ordinance, policy, amendment, or land use or zoning provision without using the process established in this subsection, and a substantially affected person considers such regulation, law, ordinance, policy, amendment, or land use or zoning provision to be a technical amendment to the Florida Building Code, then the substantially affected person may submit a petition to the commission for a nonbinding advisory opinion. If a substantially affected person submits a request in accordance with this paragraph, the commission shall issue a nonbinding advisory opinion stating whether or not the commission interprets the regulation, law, ordinance, policy, amendment, or land use or zoning provision as a technical amendment to the Florida Building Code. As used in this paragraph, the term “local government” means a county, municipality, special district, or political subdivision of the state.1. Requests to review a local government regulation, law, ordinance, policy, amendment, or land use or zoning provision may be initiated by any substantially affected person.

The commission shall publish its advisory opinion on the Building Code Information System and in the Florida Administrative Register. The commission’s advisory opinion is nonbinding and is not a declaratory statement under s. 120.565.

(7)(a) The commission shall adopt an updated Florida Building Code every 3 years through review of the most current updates of the International Building Code, the International Fuel Gas Code, the International Existing Building Code, the International Mechanical Code, the International Plumbing Code, and the International Residential Code, all of which are copyrighted and published by the International Code Council, and the National Electrical Code, which is copyrighted and published by the National Fire Protection Association.

The determination of such errors and the issuance of errata to the code must be approved by a 75-percent supermajority vote of the commission. For purposes of this paragraph, “errata to the code” means a list of errors on current and previous editions of the Florida Building Code.

(9)(a) The commission may approve technical amendments to the Florida Building Code once each year for statewide or regional application upon a finding that the amendment:1. Is needed in order to accommodate the specific needs of this state.2. Has a reasonable and substantial connection with the health, safety, and welfare of the general public.3. Strengthens or improves the Florida Building Code, or in the case of innovation or new technology, will provide equivalent or better products or methods or systems of construction.4. Does not discriminate against materials, products, methods, or systems of construction of demonstrated capabilities.5. Does not degrade the effectiveness of the Florida Building Code.The Florida Building Commission may approve technical amendments to the code once each year to incorporate into the Florida Building Code its own interpretations of the code which are embodied in its opinions, final orders, declaratory statements, and interpretations of hearing officer panels under s. 553.775(3)(c), but only to the extent that the incorporation of interpretations is needed to modify the code to accommodate the specific needs of this state. Amendments approved under this paragraph shall be adopted by rule after the amendments have been subjected to subsection (3).

(b) A proposed amendment must include a fiscal impact statement that documents the costs and benefits of the proposed amendment.

(c) The commission may not approve any proposed amendment that does not accurately and completely address all requirements for amendment which are set forth in this section. The commission shall require all proposed amendments and information submitted with proposed amendments to be reviewed by commission staff prior to consideration by any technical advisory committee.

Proposed amendments rejected by members of the staff may not be considered by the commission or any technical advisory committee.

(d) Provisions of the Florida Building Code, including those contained in referenced standards and criteria, relating to wind resistance or the prevention of water intrusion may not be amended pursuant to this subsection to diminish those construction requirements; however, the commission may, subject to conditions in this subsection, amend the provisions to enhance those construction requirements.

(a)1. State universities, Florida College System institutions, or public school districts shall conduct plan review and construction inspections to enforce building code compliance for their building projects that are subject to the Florida Building Code. These entities must use personnel or contract providers appropriately certified under part XII of chapter 468 to perform the plan reviews and inspections required by the code. Under these arrangements, the entities are not subject to local government permitting requirements, plans review, and inspection fees. State universities, Florida College System institutions, and public school districts are liable and responsible for all of their buildings, structures, and facilities. This paragraph does not limit the authority of the county, municipality, or code enforcement district to ensure that buildings, structures, and facilities owned by these entities comply with the Florida Building Code or to limit the authority and responsibility of the fire official to conduct firesafety inspections under chapter 633.2. In order to enforce building code compliance independent of a county or municipality, a state university, Florida College System institution, or public school district may create a board of adjustment and appeal to which a substantially affected party may appeal an interpretation of the Florida Building Code which relates to a specific project. The decisions of this board, or, in its absence, the decision of the building code administrator, may be reviewed under s. 553.775.

(b) If a state university, Florida College System institution, or public school district elects to use a local government’s code enforcement offices:1. Fees charged by counties and municipalities for enforcement of the Florida Building Code on buildings, structures, and facilities of state universities, state colleges, and public school districts may not be more than the actual labor and administrative costs incurred for plans review and inspections to ensure compliance with the code.2. Counties and municipalities shall expedite building construction permitting, building plans review, and inspections of projects of state universities, Florida College System institutions, and public schools that are subject to the Florida Building Code according to guidelines established by the Florida Building Commission.3. A party substantially affected by an interpretation of the Florida Building Code by the local government’s code enforcement offices may appeal the interpretation to the local government’s board of adjustment and appeal or to the commission under s. 553.775 if no local board exists. The decision of a local board is reviewable in accordance with s. 553.775.

(c) The Florida Building Commission and code enforcement jurisdictions shall consider balancing code criteria and enforcement to unique functions, where they occur, of research institutions by application of performance criteria in lieu of prescriptive criteria.

The amount expended for maintenance projects may not exceed $200,000 per project. A facility maintenance permit is valid for 1 year. A detailed log of alterations and inspections must be maintained and annually submitted to the building official. The building official retains the right to make inspections at the facility site as he or she considers necessary. Code compliance must be provided upon notification by the building official. If a pattern of code violations is found, the building official may withhold the issuance of future annual facility maintenance permits.

(7)(a) The governing bodies of local governments may provide a schedule of reasonable fees, as authorized by s. 125.56(2) or s. 166.222 and this section, for enforcing this part. These fees, and any fines or investment earnings related to the fees, may only be used for carrying out the local government’s responsibilities in enforcing the Florida Building Code. When providing a schedule of reasonable fees, the total estimated annual revenue derived from fees, and the fines and investment earnings related to the fees, may not exceed the total estimated annual costs of allowable activities. Any unexpended balances must be carried forward to future years for allowable activities or must be refunded at the discretion of the local government. A local government may not carry forward an amount exceeding the average of its operating budget for enforcing the Florida Building Code for the previous 4 fiscal years. For purposes of this subsection, the term “operating budget” does not include reserve amounts. Any amount exceeding this limit must be used as authorized in subparagraph 2. However, a local government that established, as of January 1, 2019, a Building Inspections Fund Advisory Board consisting of five members from the construction stakeholder community and carries an unexpended balance in excess of the average of its operating budget for the previous 4 fiscal years may continue to carry such excess funds forward upon the recommendation of the advisory board. The basis for a fee structure for allowable activities must relate to the level of service provided by the local government and must include consideration for refunding fees due to reduced services based on services provided as prescribed by s. 553.791, but not provided by the local government. Fees charged must be consistently applied.1. As used in this subsection, the phrase “enforcing the Florida Building Code” includes the direct costs and reasonable indirect costs associated with review of building plans, building inspections, reinspections, and building permit processing; building code enforcement; and fire inspections associated with new construction.

"(2)(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, there shall be no material alteration or substantial additions to the common elements or to real property which is association property, except in a manner provided in the declaration as originally recorded or as amended under the procedures provided therein. If the declaration as originally recorded or as amended under the procedures provided therein does not specify the procedure for approval of material alterations or substantial additions, 75 percent of the total voting interests of the association must approve the alterations or additions before the material alterations or substantial additions are commenced. This paragraph is intended to clarify existing law and applies to associations existing on July 1, 2018.

(b) There shall not be any material alteration of, or substantial addition to, the common elements of any condominium operated by a multicondominium association unless approved in the manner provided in the declaration of the affected condominium or condominiums as originally recorded or as amended under the procedures provided therein. If a declaration as originally recorded or as amended under the procedures provided therein does not specify a procedure for approving such an alteration or addition, the approval of 75 percent of the total voting interests of each affected condominium is required before the material alterations or substantial additions are commenced. This subsection does not prohibit a provision in any declaration, articles of incorporation, or bylaws as originally recorded or as amended under the procedures provided therein requiring the approval of unit owners in any condominium operated by the same association or requiring board approval before a material alteration or substantial addition to the common elements is permitted. This paragraph is intended to clarify existing law and applies to associations existing on July 1, 2018.

(c) There shall not be any material alteration or substantial addition made to association real property operated by a multicondominium association, except as provided in the declaration, articles of incorporation, or bylaws as originally recorded or as amended under the procedures provided therein.

(a) The board may, subject to s. 718.3026 and the approval of a majority of voting interests of the residential condominium or mixed-use condominium, install or require that unit owners install hurricane protection that complies with or exceeds the applicable building code. A vote of the unit owners to require the installation of hurricane protection must be set forth in a certificate attesting to such vote and include the date that the hurricane protection must be installed. The board must record the certificate in the public records of the county in which the condominium is located. Once the certificate is recorded, the board must mail or hand deliver a copy of the recorded certificate to the unit owners at the owners’ addresses, as reflected in the records of the association. The board may provide to unit owners who previously consented to receive notice by electronic transmission a copy of the recorded certificate by electronic transmission. The failure to record the certificate or send a copy of the recorded certificate to the unit owners does not affect the validity or enforceability of the vote of the unit owners. A vote of the unit owners under this paragraph is not required if the installation, maintenance, repair, and replacement of the hurricane protection, or any exterior windows, doors, or other apertures protected by the hurricane protection, is the responsibility of the association pursuant to the declaration of condominium as originally recorded or as amended, or if the unit owners are required to install hurricane protection pursuant to the declaration of condominium as originally recorded or as amended. If hurricane protection that complies with or exceeds the current applicable building code has been previously installed, the board may not install the same type of hurricane protection or require that unit owners install the same type of hurricane protection unless the installed hurricane protection has reached the end of its useful life or unless it is necessary to prevent damage to the common elements or to a unit.

However, a board may require the unit owner to adhere to an existing unified building scheme regarding the external appearance of the condominium.

(d) A unit owner is not responsible for the cost of any removal or reinstallation of hurricane protection, including exterior windows, doors, or other apertures, if its removal is necessary for the maintenance, repair, or replacement of other condominium property or association property for which the association is responsible. The board shall determine if the removal or reinstallation of hurricane protection must be completed by the unit owner or the association. If such removal or reinstallation is completed by the association, the costs incurred by the association may not be charged to the unit owner. If such removal or reinstallation is completed by the unit owner, the association must reimburse the unit owner for the cost of the removal or reinstallation or the association must apply a credit toward future assessments in the amount of the unit owner’s cost to remove or reinstall the hurricane protection.

(e) If the removal or reinstallation of hurricane protection, including exterior windows, doors, or other apertures, is the responsibility of the unit owner and the association completes such removal or reinstallation and then charges the unit owner for such removal or reinstallation, such charges are enforceable as an assessment and may be collected in the manner provided under s. 718.116.

(e) The unit owner who is installing an electric vehicle charging station or a natural gas fuel station is responsible for the costs of installation, operation, maintenance, and repair, including, but not limited to, hazard and liability insurance. The association may enforce payment of such costs under s. 718.116.

(f) If the unit owner or his or her successor decides there is no longer a need for the electric vehicle charging station or natural gas fuel station, such person is responsible for the cost of removal of such charging or fuel station. The association may enforce payment of such costs under s. 718.116.

(g) The unit owner installing, maintaining, or removing the electric vehicle charging station or natural gas fuel station is responsible for complying with all federal, state, or local laws and regulations applicable to such installation, maintenance, or removal.

(h) The association may require the unit owner to:1. Comply with bona fide safety requirements, consistent with applicable building codes or recognized safety standards, for the protection of persons and property.2. Comply with reasonable architectural standards adopted by the association that govern the dimensions, placement, or external appearance of the electric vehicle charging station or natural gas fuel station, provided that such standards may not prohibit the installation of such charging or fuel station or substantially increase the cost thereof.3. Engage the services of a licensed and registered firm familiar with the installation or removal and core requirements of an electric vehicle charging station or a natural gas fuel station.4. Provide a certificate of insurance naming the association as an additional insured on the owner’s insurance policy for any claim related to the installation, maintenance, or use of the electric vehicle charging station or natural gas fuel station within 14 days after receiving the association’s approval to install such charging or fuel station or notice to provide such a certificate.5. Reimburse the association for the actual cost of any increased insurance premium amount attributable to the electric vehicle charging station or natural gas fuel station within 14 days after receiving the association’s insurance premium invoice.

(i) The association provides an implied easement across the common elements of the condominium property to the unit owner for purposes of electric vehicle charging station or natural gas fuel station installation, and the furnishing of electrical power or natural gas fuel supply, including any necessary equipment, to such charging or fuel station, subject to the requirements of this subsection.

Once the criteria are available and applicable to baccalaureate degrees and graduate degrees, the Board of Governors shall adopt the criteria to determine value for and prioritization of degree credentials and degree programs established by the Credentials Review Committee under s. 445.004 for designating high-demand programs of emphasis. The Board of Governors must review designated programs of emphasis, at a minimum, every 3 years to ensure alignment with the prioritization of degree credentials and degree programs identified by the Credentials Review Committee.5. Include criteria for nondegree credentials.

(c) The Board of Governors shall develop an accountability plan for the State University System and each constituent university. The accountability plan must address institutional and system achievement of goals and objectives specified in the strategic plan adopted pursuant to paragraph (b) and must be submitted as part of its legislative budget request. Each university shall submit, as a component of the university’s annual accountability plan:1. Information on the effectiveness of its plan for improving 4-year graduation rates; and2. The level of financial assistance provided to students pursuant to paragraph (h).

(d) The Board of Governors shall annually require a state university prior to registration to provide each enrolled student electronic access to the economic security report of employment and earning outcomes prepared by the Department of Commerce pursuant to s. 445.07.

(e) The Board of Governors shall maintain an effective information system to provide accurate, timely, and cost-effective information about each university. The board shall continue to collect and maintain, at a minimum, management information as such information existed on June 30, 2002. To ensure consistency, the Board of Governors shall define the data components and methodology used to implement ss. 1001.7065 and 1001.92. Each university shall conduct an annual audit to verify that the data submitted pursuant to ss. 1001.7065 and 1001.92 complies with the data definitions established by the board and submit the audits to the Board of Governors Office of Inspector General as part of the annual certification process required by the Board of Governors.

(f) If the Board of Governors of the State University System determines that a state university board of trustees is unwilling or unable to address substantiated allegations made by any person relating to waste, fraud, or financial mismanagement within the state university, the Office of the Inspector General shall investigate the allegations.

(g) The Board of Governors may consider waiving its regulations and may waive or modify the tuition differential use requirements under s. 1009.24(16)(a).

The percentage shall be no less than:a. Six percent for preeminent universities;b. Four percent for emerging preeminent universities; andc. Two percent for state universities that are neither a preeminent or emerging preeminent university.

(b) The project scoring the highest for each criterion shall be awarded the maximum points in the range of points within the points scale developed by the board. The board shall weight the value of criteria such that the maximum points awarded for each criterion represent a percent of the total of maximum points. However, the board may not weight any criterion higher than the criterion established in subparagraph (a)3.

(c) A new construction, remodeling, or renovation project that has not received an appropriation in a previous year shall not be considered for inclusion on the prioritized list required by s. 1013.64(4), unless:1. A plan is provided to reserve funds in an escrow account, specific to the project, into which shall be deposited each year an amount of funds equal to 1 percent of the total value of the building for future maintenance;2. There exists sufficient capacity within the cash and bonding estimate of funds by the Revenue Estimating Conference to accommodate the project within the 3-year Public Education Capital Outlay funding cycle; and3. The project has been recommended pursuant to s. 1013.31.

(d) The board shall continually maintain a list of all public education capital outlay projects for which state funds were previously appropriated which have not been completed. The list shall include an estimate of the amount of state funding needed for the completion of each project.

(e) The board shall review its space need calculation methodology developed pursuant to s. 1013.31 to incorporate improvements, efficiencies, or changes. Recommendations shall be submitted to the chairs of the House of Representatives and Senate appropriations committees by October 31, 2019, and every 3 years thereafter.

(b) The Board of Governors shall require each state university to conduct an annual assessment of the intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity at that institution. The Board of Governors shall select or create an objective, nonpartisan, and statistically valid survey to be used by each state university which considers the extent to which competing ideas and perspectives are presented and members of the university community, including students, faculty, and staff, feel free to express their beliefs and viewpoints on campus and in the classroom. The Board of Governors shall annually compile and publish the assessments by December 31 of each year, beginning on December 31, 2024.

(c) The Board of Governors may not shield students, faculty, or staff at state universities from free speech protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, Art. I of the State Constitution, or s. 1004.97.
